### Optional/Low Priority

- [ ] Computer Science Past Paper Questions + answers explained (fun but like just do it yourself maybe?)
- [ ] Start notes for further pure mathematics (most likely will require laTeX and heavy use of the images folder which is doable but not enjoyable)
- [ ] Focus on double science material (too many images again, but some aspects of it is at the very least possible. Kinda don't want this to take up too much storage space because it'll take quite a long time to load.)
