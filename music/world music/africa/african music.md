#### Drum Ensembles

- Very complex in rhythm and texture.
  - Different Rhythms are played at the same time
  - Rhythm patterns interlock and overlap - they form polyrhythms (many rhythms at the same time) and cross-rhythms.
    - **Cross-rhythm:** the effect produced when two conflicting rhythms are heard together.
    - **Polyrhythm:** two or more rhythms with different pulses (kinda like time signatures) are heard together

Call and response is very common in African Music.

If you can't guess what it means, guess again.
