# Uses of the b5 chord

Sometimes, a simple b5 chord fits more than a fully diminished chord or a half diminished chord.

One very obvious example is in the minor scale. The C natural minor has the notes C D Eb F G Ab Bb, while the C harmonic minor has the notes C D Eb F G Ab B C.

The tritone between B and F assumes that the chord will be a b5 chord if B is the root of the chord in a harmonic minor setting. This chord can also be found in the C major (Ionian) scale, but is used more in the context of minor in my experience.

>Note: The Bm(b5) chord (not to be confused with Bb5 is consisted of the notes B D F B (and is also the same as a G7 chord without the root!) This means that whenever you play Bm(b5), you can actually substitute that for a G7 chord instead, and you will get a similar effect (just keep the base note the same to have similar effects.)

A very common use for the Bm(b5) chord is to lead into the C minor chord. For example, something like Ab Bb Bm(b5) C [Bb Ab] is a very common chord progression that I will use if given the chance. Try playing it, you can see that the Bm(b5) chord transitions really well into C. I used this a lot in `Tartarus and Back`, and you should too!

It's a really great tool to use in minor, and resolves really well given the right context.

When using the harmonic minor scale for your harmonies, generally it's better for the melody to also use the harmonic minor scale to avoid major clashes. If you do do that, avoid the awkward augmented second interval in Ab -> B, try avoiding using those notes right next to each other, and instead substitute Ab for something like G for a less dissonant/jarring interval
