# Minor Scales

There are 3 different types of minor (Aeolian) scales.

1. Natural Minor
2. Harmonic Minor
3. Melodic Minor

These minor scales are used in very different ways, and each one has its own purpose.

#### Natural Minor Scale

This is the minor scale that follows the key signature. Nothing is different, and the chords are always built the same. In the key of C minor, the chords are Cm D(b5) Eb Fm Gm Ab Bb. These are the traditional chords that you find in any minor scale, and are somewhat boring without use of the other minor scales.

#### Harmonic Minor Scale

This is the minor scale used for harmonic purposes - as in they're used to construct the harmony of your song. The important chords that change from the Harmonic Minor scale are Gm and Bb. Those chords change to G and B(b5) respectively, allowing for more variation in the harmony (and also the melody in some cases)

An **extremely** common use of the Harmonic Minor scale is using G instead of Gm. It is probably the most common 'modal interchange' chord by far, and only the iv-I from IV-I in the major (Ionian) scale comes close.

#### Melodic Minor Scale

The melodic minor scale is used in the melodic aspect of a piece. When going up, the b6 and b7 of the natural minor are sharped to give a natural 6 and 7. On the way down, it stays the same as the natural minor.

> The main reason is because when going up the scale (and targeting the note C), you want to have the B->C relationship (they're a semitone apart so it leads into C). However, the Ab -> B relationship is very awkward (augmented second), so to solve that, the Ab gets sharped to an A and then becomes a major second relationship, a consonant relationship.
