# Modal Interchange

Sometimes, it is possible to use chords from foreign keys (but they must be *parallel*)

There are more keys than just major or minor. There are in fact, 7 different keys, which have different feelings and can be used in different situations.

A way to make up the key on the spot is to take the C major scale, and change the root.

For example:

```
C D E F G A B - C root note

D E F G A B C - D root note - all the notes are from the key of C. This mode is called the Dorian mode.
```

You don't need to remember the name of all the modes because you are only using it for making your compositions sound better, not to make your listening test score higher (modes aren't covered in the test).

However, changing the root note is not helpful because that just gives a relative key (same notes, i.e. relative minor of c major is a minor), but what we want instead is a parallel key, meaning the key signature is different, but the root note is the same.

The modes:

Below will always be in the format of (scale degree in numbers), then (notes in the relative key [relative to C]) then (notes in the C <insert mode> scale)

> Note: All scales with 2 or more flats are considered minor, while the other 3 scales are considered major scales.
>
> Dorian is the brightest minor scale while Lydian is the brightest major scale.

Ionian:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7
C D E F G A B
C D E F G A B
```
This mode is the basic vanilla 'major scale', which happens to have the modal name 'Ionian'.

```
Dorian:

1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7
D E F G A B C
C D Eb F G A Bb
```
This mode is derived from having the root of D. If you have the D major scale, you can see that the notes that are made flat from the D major scale is F (F# -> F) and C (C# -> C).
```
Phrygian:

1 b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7
E F G A B C D
C Db Eb F G Ab Bb
```
This mode is considered to be darker than the vanilla minor scale.
```
Lydian:

1 2 3 #4 5 6 7
F G A B C D E
C D E F# G A B
```
This mode is a mode I would call 'edgy bright', simply because it's very bright, to the point of being overly bright, and it almost puts you on edge. This is the only mode that has a sharped note, and the relationship between the tonic and the subdominant is actually a tritone or a diminished fifth :O
```
Mixolydian:

1 2 3 4 5 6 b7
G A B C D E F
C D E F G A Bb
```
This is the darkest of the major modes.
```
Aeolian:

1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7
A B C D E F G
C D Eb F G Ab Bb
```
This is the traditional minor key, which in my opinion is the easiest key to write in, but everyone writes extremely differently.
```
Locrian:
1 b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7
B C D E F G A
C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb
```
Locrian is the hardest mode to use ever. The root note and the fifth is already a tritone interval, and the dominant is basically always consonant to the root note. Stay away from this mode unless you want to invoke a very specific feeling (which you can get by experimenting with Locrian.) One tip is to just remember to use and emphasize the tritone interval.

These modes can be used in very different ways, but it is best to try and experiment. There are no rules to music, it just needs to sound good to your own ear. I've written several pieces where I've just relied on my ear alone, with no sense of music theory, and those pieces turn out really well most of the time. However, knowing more can certainly help with the diversity of your compositions, and I **highly recommend** checking out the other things that you see in the advanced stuff folder. There's a lot of material that I've used, and I still use them to this date.

But, how does modal interchange work? Why do we need to know about these modes when there's not much use to them on its own?

Well, modal interchange is changing modes in the middle of the song. This gives a flavour of a different key, without actually modulating to the new key. It is used for short periods of time when you want to invoke a different feeling to what you usually have in just the base key, but at the same time, it can also be used as a bridge to modulate to another key. I also used that technique in `Tartarus and Back`, where I modulated to the parallel major from C minor (aka C major from C minor).

---

A common modal interchange is replacing the IV-I cadence in major to iv-I, meaning Fm-C instead of F-C. Sometimes, the Plagal cadence (F-C) does not have the Fm completely replace the F chord, but instead has a chord 'progression' of F-Fm-C. If you play those chords on the piano, you can hear that the Fm gives a flavour of sadness to the plagal cadence. This is the second most common modal interchange after minor's V instead of v.

The right hand melody will usually take on the notes of the scale, so in Fm, you're looking for a scale with the notes F Ab and C, something that C Dorian or C Aeolian has (common examples, there are more that you could use), so the right hand will play the notes inside C Dorian or C Aeolian when the Fm plays, and will go back into C Ionian when the C chord plays again.

---

There are many other applications of modal interchange, but the F Fm C modal interchange cadence is a very simple example of one.

Another example that you could find is in a F G Am chord progression, you can modal interchange the Am with an Ab to create a somewhat happier feeling, even though the chord is typically found in a minor mode. For F G Ab, I typically use the C natural minor scale as the modal interchange scale for my melody, so during the Ab chord, the melody I will be using will be a melody in the C natural minor scale.

Experiment with this technique by yourself, it's a very helpful technique to learn and is probably my favourite technique to use :)
