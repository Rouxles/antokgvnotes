# Lydian modulation in Aeolian

Another technique that can be used in a busy minor (aeolian) piece is to modulate to Lydian to create a calming/hopeful section to the piece.

If there is a lot of activity going on during the minor piece (such as off beat bass 'stabs' to create a lot of energy), you can then create a Lydian section to have a calmer section before going back to a busy section (or possibly done in ternary form)

---

So, typically, I would go to the relative Lydian key instead of the parallel Lydian key because the modulation isn't as abrupt, and kind of makes sense compared to using something like modal interchange from C Lydian. However, remember that music composition has no rules, and you should do what you want to as long as your ears agree with it.

An example of the Lydian modulation would be:

```
Cm Bb Ab G

Above is a normal chord progression in the song, response of a call and response which leads to another phrase. We could make this a Lydian phrase instead of an Aeolian phrase. Modulating to the relative Lydian key would mean having the tonic as a Ab major triad. So what we do in this case would be to start the next phrase on an Ab major chord, and go from there.

Ab - this sort of lightens up the mood without changing the key center of the piece by a lot.

Bb/Ab - this chord is very common in lydian, where you have the major II chord with the Lydian root as the bass, which emphasizes the Lydian tonality (in the #4 found between Ab and D). [Usually in a typical Ab major scale, the D would be a Db, but having the D sharped creates the Lydian tonality that we are looking for in this section]

Gm7 - this chord is the chord that makes the most sense following the Bb/Ab chord, all that happens is that the Ab bass becomes a G, which then creates a Gm7 chord assuming none of the other notes in the Bb/Ab chord change.

Csus4 C - This would be a nice chord to follow Gm7 to emphasize the F played in the Gm7 chord (because Csus4 is C F G, creating a chord that wants to resolve back to C.)

Ab Bb/Ab Gm7 Csus4 C would be a nice chord progression to go to in a Lydian section of a piece, before a transition phrase leading back to the Aeolian section. Keep in mind, the Lydian section is voiced as being far more calm than the Aeolian section.

So in tartarus and back, I plan to use the Lydian section as such:

Ab Bb/Ab Gm7 Csus4
Ab Bb/Ab Csus4 C [Cm]

The Cm is just shown as a transition into C minor. I go from Csus4 to C to Cm which is just a descent by a semitone each time. Interesting harmonies can be done with that, it's just extremely hard to execute correctly unless you listen carefully and write your harmonies/melodies to fit it.

When using the Csus4 C chord 'progression', I highly recommend not using the E note in the melody (the third) because it clashes with the Csus4 (unless you intentionally want to have a Cadd4 chord instead of a Csus4). For these situations, I would typically end the melody on either a G or a C, because those are the two tones that don't give away the key signature during a C chord.
```

Fun.
