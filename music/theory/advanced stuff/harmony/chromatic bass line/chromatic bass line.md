# Chromatic Bass Line

This is something used in a very specific way, and there aren't many applications for this, however, it is super helpful to use if you know when to use it (and it works well with something like the Lydian modal mixture section)

This technique basically makes the bass in the harmony descend by semitones, and kinda creates a 'jazzy' effect if used in the right situations with a bit of mystery.

This is usually used in a minor (aeolian) key, because this key has generally been filled to the brim with many different modal mixtures, so much that some of them feel 'normal' to us, and they feel like they're part of the aeolian key even though they're not.

So, how do we use this?

```
Cm -> G/B -> Bb -> F/A -> Ab -> Gm -> D7/F# -> G
```

Notice how the bass line is descending by semitones, but the harmony is at the very least functional?

The bass line is C B Bb A Ab G F# which then goes to the V chord then back to the I chord giving it a cadence to end. Additionally, a secondary dominant is used to go to the G key (D7 -> G), which allows for the F# bass to work in this chord progression, while every other chord in the progression is at least found in a typical Aeolian piece. (The major IV chord is the rarest chord to find in the progression, but it gives it the sense of mystery). Sometimes, the final G chord can lead to a C major chord instead of a C minor chord to have a nice Picardy third before a transition phrase leading back to Cm which then continues the progression again.

Sometimes, this could be used to spice up a minor piece on the second iteration of a motif. Try and see if it works for some of your pieces (although you will have to change up the melody at some parts to avoid dissonance)

For example, during the F/A chord, usually the melody would be better if that section ended on something like an F note or a C note (for that part, I like the idea of the melody somehow leading to C, then having a Bb-B-C chromatic ascent with the C note lining up with the Ab chord following the F/A). That's very confusing, but at least you kinda parallel the chromatic descent with a chromatic ascent in the melody :O
