# Intervals

How do they work?

Basically, an interval is to determine the amount of semitones between two different notes, but they have 90000 different names that you have to learn. Oops!

So, C->G would be a Perfect Fifth. This is because the distance between C and G is 5 notes (in the scale of C major), and G is located in G major, so the interval is perfect. Very confusing, but you do need to learn it.

So, there are 3 different intervals that are "Perfect" when they aren't changed (Perfect, diminished or augmented), while the other intervals can only be major, minor, diminished or augmented.

Those 3 intervals are the Fourth, the Fifth, and the octave. These intervals can only be Perfect, Diminished or Augmented.

**But what do those words mean?**

First, let's cover the other intervals, before moving onto those.

**Major** third means an interval where the root note and the third can be found in the root's major scale. For example, E and G# would make a major third, because G# is located in E major. Same can be applied to B and D# - D# can be found in B major, so the interval is a perfect third, assuming B is the root note (the lowest note)

Major essentially means that the target note is in the key of the root note's major scale.

**Minor** third means an interval where the third is a semitone below the note that can be found in the root's major scale. For example, E and G would make a minor third, because G is one semitone below G#, which is located in the E major scale.

**Augmented** is basically the opposite of a minor third. Instead of having a tone be lower by a semitone (compared to the major key) like minor, the tone is now a semitone above, thus the name augmentation. The augmented third with E as a root would need to be G## (not G# or A, G##). Using C as the root, the augmented third would be E#. This is written as E# instead of F because if it was written as an F, the interval would be a perfect fourth. The number used to describe is based on the 'distance between the letters' if that makes sense.

**Diminished** applies differently to the non-perfect and perfect intervals. With a normal interval, it will be a diminished interval if it is flatted twice from the major (or flat once from a minor interval). For example, E -> G is a minor third, while E -> Gb is a diminished third. For perfect intervals however, when it is made flat once from the perfect interval, it is now a diminished interval. For example, C -> G is a perfect fifth, C -> Gb is a diminished fifth. C -> F# would still be an augmented fourth though.

What interval is this? (C -> D)

**Spoiler:** because the distance from C to D is two notes, we know that the interval is a second. This is a major second because this can be found in the key of C major (our root)

What interval is this? (C -> Gb)

**Spoiler:** The distance between C and G is a 5 notes, so it is a fifth. Gb cannot be found in the key of C (and is one semitone below the 'G' note in the key of C major), so the interval is a diminished fifth.

What interval is this? (C# -> G)

**Spoiler:** The distance between C and G is 5 notes, and the note G is in the key of C major. However, the note C# is one note closer to G than C, meaning that the interval is smaller, and therefore the interval is flat, so you can treat it similarly to a C -> Gb interval, meaning it's a diminished fifth. You don't need to work in the key of the root, just need to do some quick maths to calculate the ending interval.
