I personally like writing music in minor way more than writing in major, and I know many more tricks when it comes to writing in minor compared to writing in major.

First thing, don't be afraid to make use of the harmonic/melodic minor scales. You don't play them in ABRSM exams for nothing (although it may seem like it :P)

They're called the melodic/harmonic minors because each of them were to be used in either the melody or the harmony. In the melodic minor scale, it is played differently on the way up compared to on the way down because in a minor setting,  playing the natural 6 and 7 on the way up leads to the tonic note really well (because the natural 7 is a semitone below the tonic, and flat 6 to 7 is an augmented second which is a super hard interval to use). On the way down though, there is no need to target the C note (our tonic), so leading 'down' to the C note is not necessary when going down.

So for example, if you have something like a Cm Bb Ab G chord progression, the G chord could be played with a melody that goes something like G A B C D Eb. Sometimes, this is useful when writing melodies.

Harmonic minor can be used far more frequently. Basically, the b7 is raised to the natural 7, making a semitone difference between the 7 and the tonic. This allows for a lot of variation in harmony. (This doesn't mean that every chord/melody needs to follow the harmonic minor scale). For example, something like replacing Gm with G is very common, and sometimes, an Ab Bb Bm(b5) Cm chord progression is common (the Bm(b5) chord wants to resolve to Cm).

Using harmonic minor chords, you can give a minor pieces a lot of tension compared to if you just exclusively used chords from the natural minor.

Cm Bb Ab G

Ab Bb G7 Cm

These two examples are good uses of the harmonic minor (the G7 and G chords are part of the harmonic minor scale, not the melodic minor scales), and if you have an opportunity to use them, use them.

If you have a busy section, follow it off with a calm section (that starts with the b6 chord). This is a transition into a different major key temporarily, before going back into minor. This could be something like:

> Cm Bb Ab G - old minor section
>
> Ab Bb/Ab Gm7 Csus4 C - major key section transition
>
> Ab Bb/Ab Gsus4 G - transition back into minor section
>
> Cm Bb Ab G and so on

Above would be a good example of going temporarily into a calmer section before moving back to a busy minor section.
