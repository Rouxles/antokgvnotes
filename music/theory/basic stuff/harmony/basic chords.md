# Basic Chords

Let us first start with the names of the notes in a key.

1 - Tonic
2 - Supertonic
3 - Mediant
4 - Subdominant
5 - Dominant
6 - Submediant
7 - Leading note

In C major, 1 would be C, 2 would be D and so on and so fourth. Those are the note relations (to the tonic) and their names.

The chords that you need to know for the exam are:
1. Tonic - I
2. Subdominant - IV
3. Dominant - V
4. Supertonic - ii
5. Submediant (relative minor) - vi

The Tonic, Subdominant and Dominant are considered the primary chords (basically the major chords in an ionian major scale) while the secondary chords are the minor chords in the scale (ii, iii and vi - they happen to be the same chords as the i iv and v in the minor scale.)

You also need to know about cadences (covered in another document), and about the dominant seventh chord (V7).

#### Dominant 7th

The dominant 7th chord is an added note to the normal dominant chord. In a typical dominant chord (let's use G as an example), you have the notes G B D G, while with the dominant 7th, you have the minor 7th added, which then becomes G B D F. B and F make up a tritone (which long story short is the most dissonant interval in all of music), which gives it a strong want to be resolved with the tonic chord. You should be able to hear this dominant 7th chord very easily. Just try playing the G7 chord then the C chord, and compare that with playing the G chord then the C chord.
