This is a technique in a minor (Aeolian) song.

A Picardy third is used to end a musical phrase that ends on a minor tonic chord. If the key I am in is C minor, and I want to end a section or the song itself, I will substitute the final tonic minor chord for a tonic major chord. In a minor setting, this tool will basically only work for the end of a phrase (unless you add a sus4 chord before the major chord, then it can work as a transition phrase)

Below is the end of my song

Cm Bb Ab G

C - Ending phrase to the song - this gives the song a bright and 'floaty' feeling to either end off a minor section or to end off the piece entirely.

This tool is very hard to use if you're not trying to use a relative Lydian modal mixture, but can be used if you add a sus chord before it as mentioned before.

For example, you could have a phrase that goes Ab Bb Csus4 C (which is still a Lydian modal mixture, but less obvious)

Sometimes, I like using a mini Picardy third during my Lydian sections, where the chord progression goes

Ab Bb/Ab Gm7 Csus4 C
Ab Bb/Ab Gsus4 G Gsus4 G

(which transitions really well back into C minor)

TL;DR: End off a minor piece with a major tonic chord instead of a minor tonic chord.
