# Cadences

There are 4 different types of cadences:

1. Perfect Cadence
2. Imperfect Cadence
3. Plagal Cadence
4. Interrupted Cadence

---

Perfect and Plagal cadences are the cadences that resolve, while Imperfect and Interrupted Cadences are the cadences that want to be resolved in a way.

---

#### Perfect Cadence

A perfect cadence is the strongest resolution. It's a chord progression of the **V chord and the I chord**, and is kind of like a full stop, but in musical phrasing as opposed to a sentence. If you have a piano nearby, play these chords in succession:

G -> C.  
(G B D) -> (C E G)

You can hear the resolution in this cadence. To take this further, play the chords F G C. This is a very common cadence, which goes from the IV to the V to the I.

#### Plagal Cadence

A plagal cadence also feels like a full stop, but it is more of a gentle and mellow ending compared to the strong and powerful full stop that you get with the Perfect Cadence.

The Plagal Cadence consists of the chords IV and I, and is also commonly associated as a 'church cadence', making its other name, the Amen Cadence.

Play the chords F -> C on something (preferably a piano). You can hear how it does end on a full stop, but it ends in a more church-like way, more mellow and 'sad' compared to the powerful Perfect cadence.

#### Imperfect Cadence

This cadence is the equivalent of a comma in a sentence. The phrase isn't finished, and the phrase needs to be finished.

Something like this,

(would be an imperfect cadence. Without this phrase, you'd feel lost and would have no idea what's going on.)

The imperfect cadence would be something that is ?->V, basically any chord into the dominant would make an imperfect cadence. This makes the phrase sound incomplete, and another phrase needs to happen to finish the sentence. Usually, a phrase ending with an imperfect cadence is followed by a phrase with a perfect cadence.

```
C Em F C F C [G G7] - imperfect cadence, phrase ends on the dominant (seventh)
C Em F C F C [G C] - perfect cadence, phrase ends V - I.
```

#### Interrupted Cadence

This is a cadence that is more of a question mark. Most of the time, the interrupted cadence is a cadence that goes to the relative minor instead of the tonic (for example, V -> vi). This feels like a question mark (if you weren't ready for it). For example, play F G C a few times, then play F G Am afterwards. You can hear the question mark punctuation that it kinda creates.

This makes way way way more sense if you play and experiment with cadences on piano, and learn how to identify them by ear.
