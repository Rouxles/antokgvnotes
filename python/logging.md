# Logging in Python 3

Logging is a very basic feature of Python that doesn't do anything in terms of coding, but is very useful for helping with debugging and provides a good log (duh) of what's going on as long as the programmer sets it initially.

**First of all, you need to import the logging function**

To do so, do `import logging` at the top of your python file.

This will put the prebuilt function of logging that python has, and imports it into your python file.
