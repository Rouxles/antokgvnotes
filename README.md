# Anto's Notes

**Click on the folders** for other stuff that you may or may not need (such as Computer Science notes primarily). All files are markdown files and you can view them through this repo. Will mainly be used during IB, but some of the new stuff will be from IGCSE.

The folders are there to sort out stuff. Sometimes I will sort things by date, but most of the time it isn't necessary.

No need to download anything - you can just click through the folders on this website and click on the .md (short for markdown) files. They can be viewed on GitHub itself, and will be formatted correctly there as well.

There will be a lot of folder navigation, but this allows for easy images that can be placed in every folder for easier references (and relative references for images, not direct references) which doesn't matter for you but matters a lot for me.

To see what I plan to do, click CHECKLIST.md in the root folder. It will say what I plan to do (and in which priority I want to do them in).
