# Reharmonization of the Ionian (Major) Scale

Reharmonization basically means to take the same melody but to put a different harmony underneath.

> Note: Reharmonization is very common in Jazz composition, but can also be used in any regular composition if you want a different flavour to the composition.

So, in a major (Ionian) scale (let's use C major), I highly highly highly recommend against using C (the tonic) as the starting chord. It makes the piece sound like a nursery piece, and in my opinion is what makes so many major pieces bad and clichÃ©. Even though many websites tell you to do so, I personally dislike that.

So what does reharmonization have to do with that?

It's to change the harmony of the starting chord. Instead of using C as our starting chord, we could use another chord that has C in it. This could be Am (avoid using Am cause you're just gonna be writing in A minor most of the time if you start off with that which defeats the purpose of reharmonizing for major), it could also be F (my preferred starting chord for major keys), or it could be some obscure chord like Dm7 (D F A C).

> Note: There are no rules in music, and if you feel like you have something going with starting with the C chord, go follow that idea. It just needs to sound good to you, then it will sound good to somebody else.

So in C major, I usually start with the F chord and go from there. With the F chord, most of the time you'll be following the F G (Am or C) chord progression all the time, sometimes taking a turn and using the mediant or the mediant in major (in this case, Em or E). Additionally, this chord progression is also good for using G#m(b5) as a transition from G to Am.
