# Half Diminished Chords

In chord notation, they're typically written as (x)m7b5 (i.e. Dm7b5)

The thing that makes this chord very special, is the interval called the **tritone**.

A diminished fifth (see: intervals) is an interval where the root goes up to exactly the middle of two octaves, and the sound it makes is **extremely dissonant** and jarring. It is quite possibly the most dissonant interval besides the minor second (when played together at the same time)

However, when coloured in with the minor third and the minor 7th, the chord suddenly gets a lot of flavour, and isn't just all dissonant and out of place.

It is worth noting that the half dimished chord is still considered a very dissonant chord, and will want to resolve to another chord.

#### What makes up the half-diminished chord

The half-diminished chord is made up of the root, a minor third above the root, a diminished fifth above the root, and a minor 7th above the root.

Using `Dm7(b5)` as an example (read out as D minor 7 flat 5), the chord made would be D, F, Ab, C. If you play that on a piano, you'll notice that it's still a very dissonant chord, but play it next to just the tritone (D and Ab) by itself, and you will notice the huge difference in the dissonance of the chord.

#### What uses are there?

One main use of the half-diminished chord is in a ii-V-i cadence in the minor key. If you look at the Dm7b5 chord, you can see that the notes it plays really wants to resolve into a V7 chord or a V chord.

In C minor, the Dm7b5 would be the supertonic, or the ii chord, while G would be the dominant, or the V chord (and G7 would be the dominant 7th.) If you're wondering why it's G instead of G minor, that's because in a minor key, it's very typical to have the v chord (for example Gm) be a V chord (G) instead. Try playing the chord progression Cm-Bb-Ab-G, and you'll notice that the G has a lot of grit, but doesn't sound that dissonant in minor. (This is why the harmonic minor scale has the leading note (the Bb in C minor) sharped. It is used for harmonic purposes, and the V chord instead of the v chord is an example of that. There is another example that I will go through elsewhere.)

If we replace the Ab with a G# in the Dm7b5(ii) chord (same note, just for easier observation purposes), we will get the chord D F G# C

On the other hand, the G(V) chord is made of the notes D G B D, and the G7 chord is made of the notes D G B F.

Most of the time, dissonant chords will resolve to the chord with the least amount of differences in the interval between them (basically, a semitone always).

In my composition 'Tartarus and Back', I start off the song in the intro with a very basic Dm7b5-G7-Cm chord progression. I used G7 instead of G because the Dm7b5 chord wants to resolve to the G7 more than the G chord (and the G7 chord really really really wants to resolve to the Cm chord (see: secondary dominants)).

So for Dm7b5 to resolve to G:

| Initial Note (Dm7b5 chord) | Resolved Note (G7 chord) | Relationship |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D | D | Same note |
| F | G | Major Second |
| G# | G | Minor Second (semitone) |
| C | B | Minor Second (semitone) |

As you can see, the relationship for most notes are very close to each other, and the resolution that is created is extremely obvious.

The relationship between Dm7(b5) and G7 is even closer.

| Initial Note (Dm7b5 chord) | Resolved Note (G7 chord) | Relationship |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D | D | Same note |
| F | F | Same note |
| G# | G | Minor Second (semitone) |
| C | B | Minor Second (semitone) |

Yeah, that's really close

Try using this cadence in your minor compositions if you have the chance to. It's a very powerful cadence, and is very very very useful in certain situations.

>Note: Dm7b5 can be represented as either Dm7b5 or Dm7(b5), or Ã¸. However, if you just have a pure b5 chord, it needs to be written in brackets to not be confused with a power chord. (for example B(b5) is not Bb5)
