# Secondary Dominants

The most powerful cadence is the V7 I cadence or the V7 i cadence. The dominant 7th really wants to resolve to the tonic, so you abuse this fact and use dominant 7ths of chord targets you want to emphasize. The dominant 7th wants to resolve because every single dominant 7th has a tritone between the major third and the minor 7th, creating a dissonance that really wants to be resolved. (B and F create a tritone, which is the 3rd and the m7th of G7)

Say I have a basic C G Am F chord progression, and I want to emphasize (all) the chords and give the harmony a very obvious direction. I would use secondary dominants to do so.

So, basically what you do is assume the tonic is the chord that you want to lead to (in this case, G), then you find the V7 chord of that, which would be D7. So you insert the D7 before the G, and you have a strong V7-I chord combination, even though it is out of the key.

So now, you have C D7 G Am F. What can you do to spice it up a bit?

More secondary dominants yay!!!11.

Find the secondary dominant for Am and F. The V7 for both chords are E7 and C7 respectively.

So now, our chord progression (with secondary dominants marked in brackets) is:

C (D7) G (E7) Am (C7) F [G]

The melody played during a secondary dominant is usually different to the melody played in the natural major scale. This is best left up to experimentation, but just make sure the chord tones are part of your scale as a general 'rule', and you should be able to make a good melody over these secondary dominants.

> Note: Secondary dominant chords do a very good job at helping to make a piece feel jazzy without too much effort. So, uhh use it I guess
