mute - usually a device which changes the timbre and volume of a thing

roll - tremolo on drums

double stopping - 2 strings at once on a bowed instrument

### theme and variation

theme is a motif and the theme gets varied (altered)

themes change in some way (and are varied a bit and a bit) until you vary it many times.

key principle: in some way you can tell that they are variations of the original theme.

(for example melody addition and subtraction, key, time sig, rhythm, chords, texture (think leitmotif but boring))

### textures

unison and monophonic

unison - one texture (eg happy birthday when sung)

monophonic - one melody (only one line usually) could be solo unison or double

homophonic - played in block chords - chords move around at the same speed

polyphonic - many layers - weave in and out of each other (may contain imitation and stuff) for example fugue

heterophonic - simultaneous variation of a single line (often found in gamelan music)

melody and accompaniment - literally in the name

mainly oral tradition

The percussion part in Jiangnan sizhu ensemble is played by a single musician.

Although the percussion part is not technically demanding, the percussionist plays an important role of controlling the tempo of a piece and signalling changes in tempo between sections.

As explained above, this music is performed by amateur musicians who play for recreation. Groups meet weekly in the tea-houses and/or community centres dotted around the city of Shanghai. Some members regularly attend one music club or centre, but some play in different places.
