### Hooke's law:

extension directly proportional to weight applied on it (for a spring or a wire)

limit of elasticity is where it stops being linear or directly proportional

### newton's second law

force applied = mass * acceleration

(makes sense kinda)

acceleration depends on the mass and the force applied.

same force but one is heavier means that the heavier one accelerates slower.

### calculate stopping distance (easy) - thinking distance + braking distance

depends on stuff

### terminal velocity
