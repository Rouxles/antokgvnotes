Difference between geographic poles and magnetic poles:

- Magnetic North will always point to geographic North Pole
- Magnetic South will always point to geographic South Pole

When the lines are close together, the field strength is stronger (always closer to the poles)

---

**Remember, field lines never cross or collide ever**

---

If you put like magnets together, you can see that the lines kinda repel each other. If we look at the middle of the large gap, the field strength is 0 (because the forces from the two magnets cancel each other out) We call this repulsion

However, if you put similar magnets together, you get the field lines connecting from one to the other.

If the magnets are close to each other, the lines become parallel (meaning it's a uniform field woah!)

We call this attraction.

Magnetically Soft vs Magnetically Hard

> **Magnetically Soft**
>
> This means that it will lose its magnetism very quickly (iron is an example)

> **Magnetically Hard**
>
> This means that it will keep its magnetism for a long time (Steel is an example)
