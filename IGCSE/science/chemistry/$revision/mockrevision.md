# Chemistry mock revision (fml so much to revise)

### names of interconversions

simple ones:

- boiling (from liquid to gas)
- freezing (from solid to liquid)
- melting (from solid to liquid)
- condensation (from gas to liquid)

not as simple ones:

- sublimation (from a solid to a gas (for example dry ice))
- **deposition** (from a gas to a solid)
  - can also be called desublimation

### solutes, solvents and solutions

solutes - the thing you put in the solvent

solvent - the dissolving medium (the liquid something dissolves in is called a solvent)

solution - liquid formed after dissolving the solute in the solvent is the solution

saturated solution - the solution contains as much dissolved solid as possible at a particular temperature (there must be some undissolved solute present in the solution, that will be a surefire way of knowing that something is saturated (given that it's soluble))

### elements, compounds and mixtures

elements - something with only one kind of atom

compounds - two or more elements **chemically** bonded together (hard to separate)

mixture - two or more elements mixed together (no chemical reaction occurs) - can be of any proportion

### separation of mixtures

- simple distillation
  - basically what this does is separates the solvent from the solute
  - can collect both the solute and the solvent (unlike with crystallization where you can only get the solute, not the solvent)
  - **how it works**
    - you have a side arm flask (it has an 'arm' on the side)
    - the water boils and is condensed back into a liquid by a condenser (the word condenser is derived from condensation)
    - the salt remains in the flask, while pure water is 'outputted' from the condenser
      - condenser: there are places where water goes in and water goes out. Not actually needed to make the gas condense, however it speeds it up (kinda like what a catalyst does)
- fractional distillation
  - used to separate a mixture of liquids such as ethanol and water. Ethanol and water are completely miscible with each other (meaning the mixture they form is like identical), so you can mix them together in any proportion and they will form a single liquid layer. You can separate them by taking advantage of the fact that they have different boiling points: water boils at a higher temperature than ethanol does.
  - **how it works**
    - there is a flask and a fractionating column on top of the flask. There is a thermometer on top of the flask (to see the temperature), the fractionating column has a side arm which then goes into a condenser. Basically the same process as simple distillation, but you control temperature as well because it's a mixture of liquids.
    - The liquid outputted is nearly pure
- filtration
  - used to separate insoluble solutes from solvents. Filter paper with funnel into beaker
- crystallisation
  - can be used to separate a solute from a solution.
  - the solution is heated in an evaporating basin to boil off some of the water until an almost saturated solution is formed. (dip a glass rod into the solution, if crystals form quickly then it is saturated) - then turn off bunsen burner and allow some more water to evaporate as the solution cools. The crystals can now be removed from the mixture by filtration (to get the 'pure' solute)
- paper chromatography
  - pencil line, line up inks in a solvent.

### calculating the retardation factor

distance moved by ink/distance moved by solvent = retardation factor

### metals vs non metals

metals conduct electricity, non metals generally do not (metals conduct cause when they bond metallically, a sea of electrons will form and those electrons are free to move)

non metals do not conduct electricity (because there are no electrons that are free to move) except for stuff like graphite and silicon

metals generally form basic oxides (reacts with acids to form salts)

non metals generally form acidic oxides (reacts with bases to form salts)

metals - tend to be solids, are shiny, are malleable, are ductile (can be drawn into wires), are good conductors of electricity and head, form ionic compounds and cations in their compounds

non metals - low melting and boiling points, brittle (when solids), don't shine, don't conduct electricity, poor conductors of heat, both ionic and covalent, anions in compounds

### ratio method for moles

1 mol fe2o3 reacts with c to form 2 mol fe (and co2)

we have 1000g of Fe2O3.

160g fe20e (1 mol) produces 2*56 Fe (2 moles)

160g fe2o3 = 112 Fe

1g fe2o3 = 112/160 g

1000g fe203 = 700

### determine formula of metal oxide by combustion

experiment: burn magnesium in oxygen and see how the mass changes

weigh crucible with a lid

magnesium ribbon in the crucible and weigh the crucible and contents

heat the crucible strongly (roaring flame)

when the reaction is done, let the crucible cool

weigh

example table:

| Description | Numbers |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Mass of empty crucible       | 1      |
| mass of empty crucible + ribbon | 2 |
| mass of empty crucible + contents at end | 2.69 |

work out emperical formula using this information (with oxygen and magnesium in mind with the context of this question)

### same thing but reduction

copper oxide in a ceramic dish experiment

same set of results as above, you need to weigh the thing empty, with copper oxide and after copper oxide

pass hydrogen gas through the test tube and ignite the excess hydrogen. The hydrogen gas (H2) will combine with the oxide in the copper oxide to make water which is why the copper oxide will have less mass in it at the end

calculate empirical formula using the information given above.

thanks

### Knowing charges of ions cause why the heck not

Firstly - if an ion ends in 'ide', it means there's nothing there other than the two elements (for example copper sulfide is just copper and sulfur ions)

if it ends in 'ate', there's oxygen (and maybe other things) as well. (Copper sulfate contains copper, oxygen and sulfur)

stuff you need to know:

- Ag (+) - AgCl, AgBr, AgI (for the test for halides, halides are 1-)
- Cu (2+) - CuO (oxygen is 2-, so to balance, Cu is 2+)
- Fe (2+ AND 3+) (FeO exists (with iron 2), iron 3 i don't know lol, FeO3 exists) - colours - iron III is red, iron II is green (just like traffic lights kinda, higher up is stop, lower down is go)
- Pb (2+) (PbO - exists)
- Zn (2+) (ZnO - exists in galvanizing)

- H+
- OH-
- NH4(+) (NH3 is 0, NH4 has extra hydrogen so +1)
- CO3(2-) (CaCO3 exists (Ca is group 2))
- NO3(-) (HNO3) - nitric acid
- SO4(2-) (H2S04)

### physical properties of ionic substances

high boiling and melting points because of the strong electrostatic forces of attraction holding the lattice together. A lot of energy is required to break these electrostatic forces.

They tend to be brittle because any small distortion of a crystal will bring ions with the same charge alongside each other which will make them repel and the crystal will split apart.

### electrostatic attraction for covalent

nucleus generally a positive charge

attracted to the electron pair (shared pair of electrons) - attracted to the nuclei of both atoms.

### covalent

they are usually liquid, gases or solids (with low melting points and boiling points). This is because not much energy is needed to break the intermolecular forces of attractions between molecules (which are weak). However, this doesn't break any covalent bonds because those are strong

The boiling points increase down the group because the size of the intermolecular forces of attraction becomes larger. This is because with more length, they are attracted more to other compounds, making it harder to separate them. (more opportunity for london dispersion forces - attractions between molecules)

### giant covalent structures

diamond is a form of pure carbon.

giant covalent structures are basically elements (carbon in igcse) that bond with each other a whole ton shit of times so there are barely any intermolecular forces of attraction, they're basically all covalent bonds - this means the bonds are strong and will have high boiling and melting points.

diamond is an example - does not conduct electricity, very high, and the structure is tetrahedral (so it's 3 dimensional extending from the middle)

all electrons in the outer shells of the carbon atoms are tightly held in covalent bonds between the atoms - which means none are free to move around

---

graphite - layer structure (each layer is strong but the individual layers can slide over each other)

pure graphite is so slippery it is used as a lubricant (especially cause the layers can slide over each other really easily)

high boiling and melting points as well

soft

graphite conducts electricity - there is one electron in the outer shell which is free to move around (delocalised electrons) - allows electrons to conduct electricity.

---

Fullerene - lower boiling and melting points compared to diamond and graphite because this structure is not a giant covalent structure, but actually a simple covalent molecule (because there's a fixed formula - C60)

Not as hard as diamond - does not take much energy to break the intermolecular forces of attraction.

Does not conduct electricity. electrons cannot jump from molecule to molecule

### alkali metals

they're called alkali metals because they react rapidly with water to form strongly alkaline solutions (of the metal hydroxides)

metals are very reactive and get more reactive as you go down the group - react quickly with oxygen in the air to form oxides.

all these metals react in the same way to produce a metal hydroxide and hydrogen.

2M + 2H20 -> 2MOH + H2

(M is alkali metal)

as you go down the group, the reactions happen more quickly and the elements are more reactive.

---

> Sodium
>
> sodium floats because it is less dense than water, melts into a ball because its melting point is low and a lot of heat is produced by the reaction. Fizzing is produced
>
> additionally, the sodium moves around on the surface of the water (because the hydrogen isn't given off symmetrically around the ball)
>
> the piece of sodium then disappears (used up in the reaction)
>
> the solution will become more alkali.

---

> lithium
>
> basically the same except it's slower. (because it's a lower period number compared to sodium)

Melting point is higher and heat isn't produced so quickly, so the lithium doesn't melt.

---

> potassium
>
> faster than sodiums - enough heat is produced to ignite the hydrogen (it will burn purple) - reaction often ends with the potassium spitting around and exploding (more vigorously)

---

reactions of alkali metals with the air

basically they react with air rapidly (faster with potassium than say lithium)

### group 7 halogens

- fluorine gas (F2) - gas - almost colourless - yellow
- chlorine - green
- bromine - liquid - orange/brown
- iodine - solid - grey solid

they all react with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides (H2 + Br2 -> 2BrH)

Flourine is the most reactive, while Astatine is the least reactive

melting and boiling points increase down the group (gets less reactive)

---

displacement:

2KI + Br2(aq) -> 2KBr + I2 (because Br is more reactive than I)

### gases in the atmosphere

Nitrate + Oxygen + Argon (for some reason) + Carbon Dioxide

Nitrate - around 78%

Oxygen - around 21%

Argon - 0.9

Carbon Dioxide - 0.04 (with some noble gases in the air)

### more

using copper - heat up copper with one side syringe 100cm3 and the other 0cm3

using iron - rusts in damp air. connecting tube with wet iron filings (assume small volume occupied by the iron filings is basically 0), then have air in connecting tube + air in conical flask + gas syringe initial + final.

so basically initial gas syringe + conical flask + connecting tube = initial air

Total at the end is final gas + conflask + connecting tube

then minus and do the thing over thing other

### more

phosphorus

evaporating basin on water with bell jar and phosphorus which reacts with oxygen in the air to form oxide - very soluble in water

### combustion in pure oxygen

- magnesium
  - burns in oxygen with extremely bright white flame to give magnesium oxide.
  - powder formed (magnesium oxide) is not very soluble but a small amount dissolves to form Mg(OH)2
- sulfur
  - burns in oxygen with a blue flame
  - sulfur dioxide gas is produced
- hydrogen
  - burns in oxygen to make water (pale blue flame)

Metal oxides are usually basic and are usually insoluble in water

### reducing agents and oxidizing agents

- reducing agents - this is a substance that reduces something else (for example in Mg + CuO -> MgO + Cu), the magnesium is the reducing agent because it takes the oxygen away , while CuO is the oxidizing agent because it helps to oxidize something else

### testing pH with litmus this thing and another thing

> 2.28 describe the use of litmus, phenolphthalein and methyl orange to distinguish between
acidic and alkaline solutions

litmus turns red in acid, and blue in alkali stuff

methyl orange turns orange when the mixture is more acidic (less than 6) - other than that it is yellow

that p thing turns pink when the mixture or whatever is alkali (above 8) - other than that it is colourless

### reactivity series

reactions with stuff above hydrogen in the reactivity series:

- if the metal reacts with steam, the metal oxide and hydrogen are formed
- if the metal reacts with water, the metal hydroxide and hydrogen is formed

### reactions between metals and dilute acids

- magnesium - very vigorous - fizzes, gas produced gives a squeaky pop, tube gets hot - colourless
- zinc - steady reaction, fizzing, hydrogen produced, test tube gets warmer - colourless
- iron -  slow reaction - very little gas produced, slightly green solution formed (iron 2) - test tube got slightly warmer
- copper - no change - less reactive than hydrogen

### formula of rust:

Fe2O3.xH2O

### testing for gases

hydrogen - lighted splint is held to the mouth of the tube - the hydrogen will explode with a squeaky pop.

(hydrogen combines explosively with oxygen in the air to make water)

### test for oxygen

glowing splint is put into the tube containing the gas - oxygen will relight it

### test for carbon dioxide

bubbled through limewater - it will turn it milky

(limewater is calcium hydroxide solution and it will react with it to form calcium carbonate (chalk))

Ca(OH)2 + CO2 -> CaCO3 + H2O

### test for chlorine

damp litmus paper over mouth of test tube - will first become red then will get bleached (chlorine dissolves in the water to form an acidic solution)

### test for ammonia

damp red litmus paper over mouth of test tube - will turn it blue

### test for the presence of water

anhydrous copper sulfate solution into water - if it contains water then it'll turn blue

### testing for ions:

cations:

- flame test
  - brick red - lithium | bright red - calcium | sodium - yellow | barium - green | potassium - lilac/purple | copper (II) - blue-green


sodium hydroxide + copper/iron/iron (hydroxides are insoluble except SPC)

copper - blue

iron 2 - green

iron 3 - red/brown

test for ammonium - basically you get ammonium then add hydroxide then you get water and ammonia (which you can test for)

for example NH4Cl + NaOH -> NaCl + NH3 + H2O

### testing for carbonates

add hydrochloric acid and look for fizzing (because that's carbon dioxide being given off)

then test for carbon dioxide (bubble through limewater)

### testing for sulfates

use barium chloride and hydrochloric (which will react to make barium sulfate)

### halides

cl - white | br - cream | I - yellow

nitric acid and silver nitrate (silver something which is insoluble salt)

### collision theory

reactions can happen only when particles collide, and not all collisions end up in a reaction. (many times the particles bounce off each other)

in order for a reaction to happen, the particles have to collide with a minimum amount of energy (activation energy), which means that the collisions with energy greater than or equal to the activation energy are usually called **successful collisions**

### homologous series, functional group and isomerism

homologous series - series of compounds with similar chemical properties because they have the same functional group

functional group - atom or a series of atoms that determine the chemical properties of a compound. all things in the same homologous series will have the same functional group. (functional group for alkenes is C=C)

(alkane lacks a functional group, which is what makes it an alkane ironically)

isomerism - same molecular formula but different structural formula (for example but-1-ene, but-2-ene and like 2-propene)

### substitution, addition and combustion

combustion - combustion of hydrocarbons in excess oxygen (important) gives rise to carbon dioxide and water (together with the release of a lot of heat energy - this is why the fuels are often used for burning stuff)

substitution - when an atom or group of atoms replaced with a different atom or group of atoms. (for example CH3-CH3 + Br2 -> CH3-CH2Br + HBr)

addition - when something is added to a molecule without anything being replaced. (alkenes undergo addition reactions) (for example CH2CH2 + Br2 -> CH2BrCH2Br)

### fraction names

refinery gases, gasoline, kerosine, diesel, fuel oil, bitumen

refinery gases - used for heating and cooking (as well as LPG)

gasoline - car petrol

kerosine - jet fuel (for aircraft) as well as heating oil and paraffin

diesel - for larger vehicles

fuel oil - for ships (and heating)

bitumen - to make the top surface of roads

### trend in colour, boiling points and viscosity

as the molecules become bigger:

boiling points get higher (large molecules are attracted to each other more strongly than smaller ones (london dispersion forces))

colour gets darker

gets more viscous and less volatile - stronger forces of attraction between molecules

### combustion of hydrocarbons

complete: hydrocarbon + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water

incomplete - if there isn't enough oxygen in the air

- forms either carbon or carbon monoxide
- hydrocarbon + oxygen -> carbon monoxide + water ***or*** carbon + water

### acid rain

when nitrous oxides and sulfur dioxide react in the air to make HNO3 and H2SO4 or H2SO3 which will make the rain more acidic.

sometimes will kill calcium carbonate which means rip buildings

### cracking

cause supply and demand

too many long chains

not enough short chains

more petrol (gasoline) is needed but not enough supply so basically they crack longer hydrocarbons into shorter hydrocarbons

catalytic cracking (fuel oil fraction (for ships) is heated to give a gas then is passed over a catalyst of silicon dioxide (silica) and aluminum oxide (alumina). These can be carried out at higher temperatures without a catalyst (higher activation energy though))

broken down in a fairly random way.

cracking also happens to make hydrocarbons

at the end of cracking, the mixture will need to be further separated to get everything as a pure compound (for example with more fractional distillation)

### alkanes (substitution)

alkanes react with halides (group 7 stuff) in the presence of UV light.

CH4 + Br2 -> CH3Br + HBr

or CH3CH3 + Cl2 -> CH3CH2Cl (g) + HCl

(meth eth prop but alkanes are all gases at room temperature)

Alkanes are considered saturated because they only have C-C single bonds and have no double or triple bonds.

### mono substitution

halogenoalkanes - basically mono-substitution means that only one hydrogen is displaced as the name suggests.

These things are in the form haloalkane.

For example if you have CH2Br-CH2-CH3 then this is called **1-bromopropane**. CH3-CHBr-CH3 would be called **2-bromopropane** (because of where the bromine is formed)

### alkenes

functional group C=C

unsaturated because they contain a C=C bond.

similar to alkanes (for state symbols, first 4 are gases, rest are liquids that gcse asks for) - show a trend in physical properties

combustion - alkanes burn in air to give carbon dioxide and water (but alkenes are really useful so nobody burns them)

addition - alkenes are much more reactive than alkanes and undergo **addition** reactions instead of substitution reactions. This means that part of the double bond breaks to become a single C-C bond and the electrons are used to join other atoms onto the two carbon atoms.

For example, addition of bromine (because it doesn't need any catalyst or heat or light) will add onto the alkene.

CH2=CH2 + Br2 -> CH2Br-CH2Br (1,2-dibromoethane) - dibromoethane because there are no double bonds so it's an ethane not an ethene if you get confused during the test

This test is usually carried out using aqueous bromine solution. You can tell the addition reaction has happened because bromine (which is below chlorine in group 7 and is orange, while 1,2-dibromoethane is colourless)

### test for unsaturated compounds - basically shake it with bromine water and the bromine water gets decolourized.

CH2=CHCH3 + Br2 -> CH2Br-CHBr-CH3

(propene + bromine -> 1,2-dibromopropane)

CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 + Br2 -> CH2Br-CHBr-CH2-CH3

(eth-1-ene + bromine -> 1,2-dibromoethane)

### synthetic polymers

addition polymerization - molecules simply add onto each other without anything else being formed.

many ethenes under heat and high pressures (and an initiator (basically a catalyst but is used up in the reaction)) will form a long chain (can vary from around 4000-40000 carbon atoms long.)

**polytetrafluoroethene** - CF2=CF2 which will make (-CF2-CF2-)n

addition polymers contain strong covalent monds which means that they are inert (chemically inactive) and are non-biodegradable which means that they cannot be broken down by bacteria in the environment.

two solutions:

- landfill
  - cheap
  - takes up space
  - ugly smelly and noisy
  - waste will be there for a long time
  - no greenhouse gases or toxic gases are produced
- incinerator (burning the plastic)
  - generates heat energy (for energy/electricity)
  - takes up not a lot of space
  - expensive to build
  - greenhouse gases
  - toxic gases
  - ash must still be disposed somewhere

### solubility of salts

- Nitrates
- Acetates
- Group 1 Metals
- Sulfates ++
- Ammonium
- Group 17 non-metals +

- PMS
- CaStro Bear

- Carbonates:
  - SPA (ammonium)
- Hydroxides:
  - SPC
