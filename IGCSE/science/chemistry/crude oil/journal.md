# Crude Oil in 2018

42nd of August, 2616

---

Crude Oil was something that the humans of 2018 really needed, and the problem was that they depended on it too much, and therefore caused greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere (in the form of carbon dioxide).

---

Crude Oil was used for many different things. It was made of several different types of molecules, some longer, some shorter. The longer ones had a higher boiling point (meaning a higher condensing point), while the shorter ones had lower boiling points (meaning a lower condensing point). **They separated the oil using fractional distillation**

---

Firstly, the crude oil was vaporized (evaporated instantly), which required a lot of heat, emitting carbon dioxide (due to combustion emitting carbon dioxide in its chemical reaction)

Then, the fractioning tower had several different fractions, meaning that they had different temperatures, which makes molecules of similar length condense at their given fractions.

> The fractions are as followed:
>
> - Refinery gas - Used for fires
> - Petrol/Petroleum - Cars
> - Naphtha - Used to make other chemicals
> - Kerosene - Jet Fuel
> - Diesel - Vehicles
> - Lubricating oil - Lubricant
> - Fuel Oil - Fuel
> - Bitumen - Road Building (tar-like)
>
> These fractions are in order of condensing points, where the bottom is the highest condensing (and boiling) points, while the top is the lowest condensing (and boiling) points.

Essentially, these fractions are used to separate the different parts of crude oil into usable substances (such as the fractions listed above) and their uses

#### Types of pollution

- Global Warming
  - Carbon Dioxide
- Acid Rain
  - Sulphur
  - Nitrogen (Causes when nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide mixes together. This is very harmful for plant life. )
- Global Dimming
  - Pollution causes more and more air pollution to be in the air, meaning that the air gets gradually and gradually darker
