# Natural Selection and Evolution

> **3.38** explain Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution by natural selection
>
> **3.39** understand how resistance to antibiotics can increase in bacterial populations, and appreciate how such an increase can lead to infections being difficult to control

Charles Darwin & Alfred Wallace

- Noted that natural selection/evolution was a thing

Species tend to have too much offspring.

- Variation (genetic variation so it's inheritable by offspring)
- Survival of the fittest.

Heritability: The proportion of observed differences in a trait among individuals of a population that are due to **genetic** differences

Advantages that some species have (in terms of phenotype) means that possibly, over time, the offspring get the same phenotypes in general, which makes that characteristic more common within the population.

This is natural selection (the environment acts as a pressure for selection to determine which characteristics give a better chance for survival)

If natural selection has happened so much that it is impossible to recreate the old version (so the 'new' one is now normal), this is called evolution, meaning that the species is different.

(If the population changes so much that it can no longer produce fertile offspring with its original version, a new species is said to have evolved (for example with humans and apes))

**Evolution:** Changes in gene frequencies in a population over time

# Example Questions

> Over the past several decades, natural selection has caused populations of Staphylococcus aureus (an infectious wound bacterium) to evolve resistance to most antibiotics. If antibiotic use were stopped, what would you predict would happen to these S. aureus populations?

Answer: There will be an increase in the population of these bacterium that are non-resistant to antibiotics (because they do not need to combat antibiotics)

> Starting from a single wild canine species, humans have developed hundreds of breeds of domestic dogs. Which of the following statements is supported by this observation?

Answer: There was enough heritable variation in the wild canine species to create a variety of features.

> Claytonia virginica is a woodland spring herb with flowers that vary from white to pale pink to bright pink. Slugs prefer to eat pink-flowering over white-flowering plants (due to chemical differences between the two), and plants experiencing severe herbivory were more likely to die. The bees that pollinate this plant prefer also prefer pink to white flowers, so that Claytonia with pink flowers have greater relative fruit set (reproductive success) than Claytonia with white flowers. A researcher observes that the percentage of different flower colors remains stable in the study population from year to year. If the researcher removes all slugs from the study population, what would you expect to happen to the distribution of flower colors in the population over time?

Answer: The percentage of pink flowers should increase over time.
