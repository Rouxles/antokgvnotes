### Structure of a cell

> describe cell structures, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, cell wall,
mitochondria, chloroplasts, ribosomes and vacuole

nucleus - chromosomes ree - controls activity in cells

cytoplasm - kinda the liquidy part of the cell - jelly-like - contains many different organelles

cell membrane - selectively permeable - kinda allows certain things to go in the cells

cell wall - exclusive to plants - it's a layer of non-living material found outside the cell membrane in a plant. It is made of celluose, which is a tough structure. This allows the cell to keep its shape. Because plants absorb water, there will be an internal pressure inside the cell which pushes on the wall, which gives plant support (and keeps their shape intact as said earlier)

mitochondria - this organelle appears in areas where cells need a lot of energy (for example muscle and nerve cells). Respiration produces energy (ATP), which means that mitochondria is linked to respiration. They carry out some of the reactions of respiration, providing energy that the cell can use.

chloroplasts - photosynthesis for plants (chlorophyll)

Ribosomes - where the proteins are assembled (through RNA)

Vacuole - fully grown adult plant shave a vacuole which is a large central space surrounded by a membrane. This membrane is called a vacuole. It is a store of dissolved sugars, ions and other solutes.



### Variety of Living Organisms

> Describe the common features shown by eukaryotic organisms such as plants, animals, fungi and protoctists
>
> Eukaryotic - has a nucleus

Plants - have cell wall made of cellulose, have chloroplasts (which are the organelles responsible for photosynthesis), store carbohydrates as sucrose and starch.

Animals - Do not have chloroplasts, cannot photosynthesize, have no cell wall, store carbohydrates as glycogen, have nervous coordination and can move from one place to another.

Fungi - These are organisms with a cell wall made of **chitin** (not cellulose like in plants). Their body is usually thread-like mycelium made of **hyphae**. They eat by saprotrophic nutrition, where the digestion happens outside the cell, which is then absorbed by the fungi

Protoctists - These are organisms that don't fit into the above catagories. They are usually unicellular, where some can photosynthesize, and some cannot. Some protoctists are pathogens, such as Plasmodium, which causes malaria.

### Prokaryotic organisms

Bacteria - single celled - no nucleus, has a chloroplast instead and plasmids. Some can photosynthesize but most feed off other organisms.

Viruses - No nucleus or cytoplasm - just a core of genetic material that is DNAA or RNA which is surrounded by a protein coat. Not considered a living cell by scientists and are parasites.

An example of a virus is the tobacco mosaic virus which makes tobacco leaves lose some of their chloroplasts and turn yellow. HIV is another example of a virus which can then morph into AIDS. Influenza causes the flu

### Level of Organization

Organelles - the 'organs' in the cells

Cells - the cells lmao

tissues - a group of cells that have similar function (for example the right tricep muscle tissue)

organ - collection of several tissue of similar function

system - an organ system (for example nervous/endocrine[hormone secretion])

### Chemicals present in carbohydrates, lipids and proteins

Carbohydrates - basically the elements found in glucose (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen)

Lipids - same as carbohydrates (remember it as it's also a source of energy so same resources or something - maybe broken down into glucose to release the energy or something like that idk)

Proteins - same as carbohydrates, but with the addition of nitrates. (nitrates in plants are used to make protein and amino acids)

### Structure of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins

Lipids are made from fatty acids and glycerol

Carbohydrates are made from simple sugars such as glucose. Same goes with starch and glycogen.

Proteins are made from amino acids

### Test for nutrients

starch - drip iodine solution - if starch, turns from orange to blue black

test for glucose - benedict's blue solution. Water bath heat food with benedicts blue inside (preferably grinded and filtered). If has glucose, the solution goes from blue to some other colour

test for proteins - buiret (reagent) solution. If there are peptide bonds (eg protein bonds) then there will be a purple colour which develops after mixed with the protein.

test for lipids - fats and oils cannot dissolve in water but will dissolve in ethanol/sudan III. Add 3 drops of sudan 3 to food solution in a test tube. If the food contains lipids, a red layer will float on top of the test tube.

### structure of a leaf

leaves are adapted for photosynthesis.

there is a waxy cuticle layer which traps moisture and 'prevents' moisture from evaporating from the leaf (especially because photosynthesis requires water, and if water were to evaporate from the chloroplast-filled leaves, then photosynthesis were to be less effective)

Below the waxy cuticle layer, you have the upper epidermis. This layer is transparent (allows light through) and also relatively thin. This gives the leaf a bit of protection and also contains **stomata**, but not as many as can be found in the **lower epidermis**. This acts as a barrier to pathogenic organisms affecting the chloroplasts.

> Definition: **mesophyll** - middle of the leaf (rhymes with chlorophyll which is what is what does the photosynthesis thing)

Palisade mesophyll - layer where basically all of the chloroplasts are located, and where most photosynthesis happens. Because light usually comes from the top of the plant, and the top layer of the plant is transparent (just the cuticle and upper epidermis, which both are transparent), so most of the light will hit the palisade mesophyll. This is a tissue made of long narrow cells each containing hundreds of chloroplasts (is the main site of photosynthesis). Cells are relatively long (columnar). They receive carbon dioxide from diffusion from the layer below, the **spongy mesophyll**.

Spongy mesophyll - layer where the tissue is more rounded and loosely packed (lots of air spaces). They can also photosynthesize, but have far fewer chloroplasts than the palisade cells. They form the main gas exchange surface of the leaf, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen and water vapor.

> The air spaces allow gaseous exchange - carbon dioxide to the cells, and oxygen away from the cells during photosynthesis.

Next 'layer' is the vein of the plant - this is located at around the same level as the spongy mesophyll - they contain xylem and phloem.

> xylem: brings water and minerals to the leaf - water is absorbed by the roots and passes up through the stem and through veins in the leaves in the transpiration stream. Inside the leaf, the water leaves the xylem and supplies the mesophyll cells (which is why the vein is located near the mesophyll cells)
>
> transpiration stream: the flow of water through a plant, from the roots to the leaves, via the xylem vessels.

> pholem: The products of photosynthesis (such as sugars (sucrose)) are carried away from the mesophyll cells (another reason why it's close to the mesophyll cells) - Phloem takes the nutrients and products of photosynthesis to other parts of the plant so that they can receive energy even without being able to photosynthesize.

Stomata - these are located at both the upper epidermis and the lower epidermis (however, it is far more common and frequent to find at the lower epidermis.) Stomata are basically holes/pores which allow carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf. Each stoma (single form of stomata) has two guard cells which change their shape to open or close the stoma (depending on whether there is light present).

Think of this as guard cells 'guarding' the holes or something lmao

When the stomata are closed, then there will be less transpiration (giving off water vapour through pores) and also less gas exchange will happen (because photosynthesis is not needed as much - the plant just needs to respire)

### mineral ions for plant growth

nitrate - is one of the elements present in protein (if you don't remember, look above). Plants need nitrates to produce proteins and amino acids (along with **chlorophyll**) and DNA.

> If there is a deficiency of nitrate, the plant won't grow much (remember protein helps with growth in humans) and also older leaves will turn yellow (because chlorophyll is produced from protein which means that there is a lack of green or something like that)

phosphate - you don't need to remember this, but it is good to understand it just for the memes - useful for making DNA and many other compounds - part of the cell membrane.

> If there is a deficiency, younger leaves turn purple for some reason, and the roots also grow poorly.

potassium - you don't need to remember this, but it is good to understand it just for the memes - needed for enzymes of respiration and photosynthesis to work

> If there is a deficiency, basically there will be less respiration and photosynthesis, which then leads to some parts of the plant dying (due to the lack of energy and glucose, produced from respiration and photosynthesis respectively.)

magnesium - magnesium is a part of the chlorophyll molecule, so basically if there is a lack of magnesium, the leaves will turn yellow because there is a lack of chlorophyll (which is green)

### requirements of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis

soda lime absorbes carbon dioxide (just say something like an agent that absorbs carbon dioxide in the test.)

### sources and functions of nutrients

lipids - fats and oil - a source of insulation (and also an energy storage system) - can be found in meats

protein - can be found in meat - used for growth and repair (especially if you consider that all cells have protein, and enzymes are made of protein as well)

> If there is a lack of protein, there will a problem of lack of growth lmoa

iron - helps with respiration and carrying oxygen found in the blood (because it helps with the 'generation' of haemoglobins.) You can find iron in red meat, liver eggs and some vegetables (just remember meat, and i guess how there is iron because there needs to be a way to generate haemoglobins or something in living animals that need to breathe and transport oxygen around their body)

calcium - helps with bones - making sure bones stay strong (and teeth) - with a lack of calcium, there will be weaker bones (which might end up curving). You can find calcium in milk and dairy yogurt.

dietary fiber - not actually used by the body for any nutrients or anything (cannot be digested). However, it helps the intestines move food, and helps faeces go out of the gut faster. Lack of this will lead to constipation (harder pooing lel)

**vitamins:**

- Vitamin A - used for healthy eyesight. Can be found in carrots. Lack of this will give lack of good vision (during night)
- Vitamin C - used for healing wounds and rebuilding tissue (similar to protein) - can be found in lemons. Lack of this will give scurvy (bleeding gums)
- Vitamin D - used for strengthening bones and teeth (because it helps the bones absorb calcium and phosphate). Can be found with skin in sunlight but also fish liver oils.

Water - required for most of the chemical reactions to take place. you can find water in water

### peristalsis

important points - longitudinal muscles, circular muscles. basically when the circular muscles contract, the longitudinal muscles relax, which will make that portion smaller and more narrow. When the opposite happens, the opposite happens. This means that the food gets pushed through like toothpaste out of the tube - works against gravity

### human alimentary canal

> mouth - mechanical digestion - has some enzymes (for example the one for starch which is amylase and maltase (carbohydrases))
>
> basically an important part of enzymes is a large surface area to volume ratio, which means that the mouth will break food down to give it a large surface area to volume ratio
>
> additionally, the food will be lubricated in saliva which will make it easier to pass through the oesophagus

> oesophagus - tube that connects the mouth to the stomach - peristalsis happens to force the food down without gravity impacting it

> stomach - has stomach acids which contain different acids (for example HCl) - Food is churned and broken down mechanically even further, while enzymes are there to break the food down chemically. The optimum pH of enzymes there are closer to 2.

> small intestine - lined with villi to create a very large surface area:volume ratio with high concentration gradient between the nutrients in the small intestine to the bloodstream, which will then be moved into the circulatory system for use.
>
> duodenum: the first part of the small intestine - the food coming right out of the stomach is acidic, and is neutralized here with bile (very alkali) coming from the gall bladder - and digestive enzymes coming from the pancreas (the pancreas produces a lot of digestive enzymes and releases them into the small intestine - small intestine basically has all enzymes - carbohydrases such as amylase and maltase, proteases such as tryspin and peptidases and lipase)
>
> ileum: highly adapted to absorb the digested food. The lining of ileum has a very large surface area as said earlier, which means that it can quickly and efficiently absorb the soluble products of digestion into the blood. The length of the intestine provides a large surface area. There are a lot of villi in the ileum, which basically increases surface area. Each villi also has microvilli **similarily to a fractal**, which increases the surface area even further.

> large intestine - elimination of waste - Water is absorbed from undigested food to create faeces (stored in the rectum and removed through the anus lmoa)
>
> the first part of the large intestine - the colon - used to absorb most of the remaining water from the contents, which is stored in the rectum and removed through the anus.
>
> think of it like water: <- that's a colon, where water is taken out of the contents or something meme like that

> pancreas - produces enzymes - amylase, maltase, some protease, lipase.
>
> secretes these enzymes into the stomach and the small intestine for chemical breakdown of food (enzymes are biological catalysts or something meme like that)

### role of bile to emulsify Lipids

bile both neutralizes food coming out of the stomach (to make enzyme activity high again in the small intestine designed to work in neutral pH).

emulsifying lipids basically is breaking down lipids into small droplets which increases surface area:volume ratio which makes it easier for lipase enzymes to break it down more easily.

### structure of a villus and why the small intestine is good for absorbing stuff

> SI has very high surface area which allows for quick and efficient absorption of soluble products of digestion into the blood.
>
> adaptations: very thin cell walls - one cell thick, makes the process of diffusion far easier because the digested soluble materials only need to diffuse a certain amount - efficient rate of diffusion
>
> large surface area to volume ratio - more molecules can diffuse into the villi at once
>
> strong concentration gradient provided by blood supply (which comes from the villi, which contain networks of capillaries) - efficient rate of diffusion of digested molecules
>
> lacteal - transports fatty acids and glycerol away from the small intestine (i guess because the blood stream does not want these products)

### production of carbon dioxide by small living organisms

> hydrogen carbonate indicator - turns yellow if carbon dioxide is added to it. Gauze platform to make sure the organism is located above the solution - stops them from coming into contact with the chemical.

### gas exchange

> The lungs are located in the chest (known as the **thorax**) by the ribcage and a muscular sheet of tissue called the diaphragm at the bottom of the lungs. Joining each rib to the next are two sets of muscles called the intercostal muscles. Diaphragm separates the thorax from the abdomen.
>
> the walls of the windpipe and the bronchi are filled with cartilages which support the airways and keeps them open when we breathe in. Without them, they would collapse when we breathe in. (basically has the same function as a cell wall but not really)
>
> each bronchus (left and right) divides into smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles, eventually ending at alveoli where gas exchange takes place with blood (through diffusion and stuff)
>
> The inside of the thorax is separated from the lungs with two thin moist membranes called the pleural membranes, which makes a continuous envelope around the lungs, forming an airtight seal - kinda is a fluid and helps the surfaces of the lungs not stick to the inside of the chest wall when we breathe (acts as lubrication basically)

### more gas exchange

> when you breathe in, the external intercostal muscles will contract and tighten (while the internal intercostal muscles relax), which will push the ribs up and out. In addition to that, the diaphragm will contract, pulling it to a flat shape, which will make the volume of the thorax increase, thus decreasing pressure (think physics). This will force air from outside to fill the lungs to make the atmospheric pressure 1atm, which pushes air into the lungs. When the opposite happens, the diaphragm will relax, alongside the external intercostal muscles. This will lead to the thorax having higher than atm pressure, forcing air out of the lungs.

### alveoli gas exchange

> they are surrounded with capillaries. The deoxygenated blood will have more carbon dioxide and less oxygen (due to the respiration from the mitochondria), which will create a concentration gradient with the alveoli. (in the lungs, first loop around the heart from the right ventricle)

### effects of smoking

> tar covers windpipe - cilia less effective keeping airway cleans, because **cilia** are shorter. (the chemicals in cigarette smoke destroy the cilia, making it harder to breathe in.) The fact that there are less cilia means that mucus is not swept away as effectively, and blocks air passages instead. The smoker will then want to cough more - smoker's cough.
>
> eventually this will lead to bronchitis which blocks normal air flow so the sufferer has difficulty breathing properly.

### more effects of smoking

> smoke also damages the walls of the alveoli - which break down and fuse together again, forming enlarged, irregular air spaces. There is far less surface area which makes for far less efficient gas exchange, and it is not sufficient to supply the body of oxygen in some serious cases. Sometimes, the patient will always need a supply of oxygen nearby.
>
> lung cancer - a very large correlation is between lung cancer and smoking. The risk of getting lung cancer is far greater if you smoke compared to if you don't.
>
> effects on the heart - coronary heart disease - The coronary arteries are one of the narrowest in the body, which means they are easily blocked by a build-up of fatty substances in their walls (including cholesterol) - smoking raises blood pressure and makes blood clots more likely to form which makes coronary heart disease more likely (which can be fatal because the cardiac muscle will no longer be able to receive oxygen and glucose - which makes it not be able to respire)

### composition of blood

> red blood cells - no nucleus (because it allows the red blood cell to carry more haemoglobins and also allows the bi-concave shape of the red blood cell which helps with diffusion (high sa:volume ratio memes)) (when haemoglobins bind with haemoglobins it is called oxyhaemoglobins) They are thin - efficient diffusion (also there are many, sa:vol)
>
> plasma - the liquid part of the blood - mainly water. It carries the blood cells around the body, carries dissolved nutrients, hormones, carbon dioxide and urea. Distributes heat around the body (water is good at carrying heat)
>
> white blood cells:
> - lymphocytes - they produce antibodies which target specific microorganisms - about 25% are these - they basically have multiple functions but they produce antibodies which are released into the plasma and target specific antibodies by helping phagocytes identify and ingest them as well as neutralizing their poisons. They don't do any killing but kinda mark the bacteria if that makes sense
> - phagocytes - digest and destroy bacteria and other microorganisms (about 70% of the white blood cells are these) - they engulf
> - platelets - produces a chemical to make blood clot at a wound when we cut ourselves (really small)

### structure of the heart

basic remembering

ventricle is at the bottom (which is the part where the blood gets pumped out). think i guess that veins lead into arteries which lead into veins into arteries or something (and like atrium kinda sounds like arteries lmao)

pulmonary - lungs

hepatic - liver

hepatic portal - from the small intestine (digestive system) to the liver

renal - kidney

artery - away from the heart

vein - towards the heart

pulmonary artery blood is deoxygenated, all other artery blood is oxygenated.

the atrium -> ventricle has valves as well as the arteries having valves.

### structure of veins and arteries and capillaries

> veins: large lumen relative to the walls - thin walls which little muscle and elastic tissue.
>
> artery: carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Very high pressure which means there is elastic tissue and veerty muscular which helps control the flow of blood by dilating or constricting. Muscular to keep the blood pressure along with not bursting under pressure basically
>
> capillary: very small (one cell thick) and brings the blood close to every cell in the organ. This allows the substances in the capillary to exchange easily (due to concentration gradient and stuff). These are usually located at the 'turning points' between the veins and the arteries.

### more on coronary heart disease

> factors:

- heredity - inherit a tendancy to develop coronary heart disease (rip)
- high blood pressure - more strain on the heart
- diet - more sat fats = raise cholesterol levels
- smoking - raises blood pressure
- stress - also raises blood pressure
- lack of exercise - also raises blood pressure. Exercise strengthens the heart and lowers blood pressure

basically don't have high blood pressure

### carbon dioxide and oxygen waste products of metabolism and loss from stomata of leaf

- photosynthesis causes oxygen as a waste product, while respiration causes carbon dioxide as a waste product

stomata opens to allow the air to pass through basically. happens when the stomata is open.

### excretion

lungs: carbon dioxide

kidneys: urea, excess water, salts

skin: excess water (sweat), salts along with a very small bit of urea.

### phototropism and geotropism

photo - light

geo - probably something related to gravity

phototropism - positive - acts in the direction of the stimuli (wants sunlight so goes towards sunlight)

geotropism - negative - goes away from gravity because the plant wants to grow up. (the roots or the plant are positively geotropic though)

### auxin

auxin is a hormone that kinda acts negative in a way - basically it has this weird thing called auxin where it reaches more darker parts of the shoot and causes the cell to elongate there and grow there more, which will cause it to bend towards the light

### neurotransmitters

synapse is a gap between two nerve cells right - the gap is chemical and the neurotransmitters are chemicals which diffuse across the synapse and attaches to the membrane of the other neurone that it needs to get to. After the neurotransmitter has 'translated the message', it is broken down by an enzyme

### focusing with the eye

when near objects, the lens needs to get fatter, so the ciliary muscles contract and the suspensory ligaments relax. Opposite happens for the opposite (ligaments are what give tension the eye in a way)

For dark, you have circular and radial muscles. When the circular muscles contract and the radial muscles relax, the pupil will go small (in bright light) opposite for opposite (remember it by circular muscles being similar to the ones in peristalsis which makes the tube smaller and larger, the other one does the opposite)

### eye as a receptor - receives light lmoa

### testosterone, progesterone and oestrogen

oestrogen - controls the development of female secondary sexual characteristics (secreted by the ovaries), controls the stages of the menstrual cycle (sex hormone)

progesterone - regulates the menstrual cycle (maintains the uterus lining to cushion fertilized egg cell) - secreted by the ovaries (maintains pregnancy)

testosterone - controls the development of male secondary sexual characteristics - secreted by the testes (sex hormone)

### oviduct

the tube (takes egg from ovary to uterus, where fertilization happens)

### zygote

diploid as a result of two haploids in fertilization

### pollination + seed and fruit formation

male gametes - pollen

female gametes - ova (egg cells)

pollination is basically the process of fertilization for plants - which is carried out either by wind or by insects. Following pollination, fertilization takes place and the zygote takes place which develops into a **seed** which is then enclosed in a **fruit**

> when the pollen grains from another plant land on the stigma, a pollen grain grows a tube down the **style**. The pollen grain nucleus moves to the tip of the tube which will then eventually lead to entering the ovule then fertilization

pollen (male gamete) will land on the stigma, which will then travel down the pollen tube which fuses with the female gamete (the egg) in the ovule to form a zygote, then a seed.

ovules becomes seeds after pollination.

then the ovary becomes the fruit (seed bearing part of the plant)

### structure of plants (insect pollinated vs wind pollinated)

basically insect pollinated plants have traits which are there to attract insects to 'come to the plant' to both place pollen on the stigma, and to also receive pollen from the stamen. (stamen is the male part, stigma is the female part - remember it by sta**men** and if you stigma balls into something the thing you stig the balls into is female)

anther/filament

style/ovary/pollen tube

Wind pollinated plants are more made for having things which makes wind have a higher chance to 'hit' the plant (having the stigma exposed means that pollen in the wind may hit the stigma.)

Insect Pollinated Plants:

- The obvious first:
  - Large petals - also large to attract insects
  - Colourful Petals - to attract insects
  - There is nectar (sweet sugary shit) secreted from the plant as a 'reward' for insects to come to the plant and basically help fertilize the plant and create seeds
- The less obvious but still really obvious:
  - The stamen and stigma are located on the inside of the plant (where the nectar is located) so the pollen is easily transferred (enclosed inside the plant)
  - pollen are large and **sticky**, sometimes with hooks - basically they want to stick to an insect because that's how they pollinate so they are sticky lmoa
  - the stigma is sticky so pollen grains from other insects attach to it (and the pollen tube can grow to fertilize the plant)

Wind Pollinated Plants:

- Obvious:
  - no colours - wind isn't racist
  - petals are small - no need to be large + with small petal more of the plant can be exposed
  - pollen should be small and light (because they're easier to carry in the wind)
- Also Obvious:
  - Stamen is exposed (especially the anther) because it makes it so that it is easier for wind to blow the pollen away
  - Stigma is exposed - makes it easier for pollen to attach to the stigma
  - Stigma is feathery - makes it more efficient at 'trapping' the pollen in the air

> Terms to remember:
>
> anther/filament - anther is the top part of the stamen, while the filament is the stick part of the stamen
>
> the stigma consists of the style (just think of how the pollen tube styles its way down into the ovule lmoa)
>
> the whole thing is the carpel

the ovary is the large thing, while the ovule is the small (seed-like thing) inside the ovary

### seed germination

conditions - water, oxygen (respiration) and temperature (NOT LIGHT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T PHOTOSYNTHESIZE YET)

water - dry cotton wool; oxygen - put in boiled water with oil at the top; temperature - duh

the seeds have a food store. During germination, the food store is used up, providing nutrients to allow the root and shoot to grow. The root grows down where it absorbs water and minerals, while the shoot grows upwards where the plant can start photosynthesizing. Once the plant is able to photosynthesize, germination is over. This will also allow the plant to have its minerals (from xylem) and the other parts of the plant get the products of photosynthesis from phloem.

### structure of reproductive systems

male:

- penis - allows the sperm to travel into the vagina during sexual intercourse
- testes - creates sperm and also releases testosterone (male sex hormone + secondary sexual characteristics)
- glands (at the top of the penis) - produces semen (provides sperm cells with nutrients)
- sperm duct - sperm travel through the sperm duct to be mixed with the semen that go with the glands
- urethra - tube in the penis that urine and semen goes through (before 'exiting' the penis)

female:

- oviduct - it's a tube where fertilization happens - lined with cilia-like cells to push the released ovum towards the uterus (middle part of the vagina).
- ovary - the side parts of the vagina - produces the ova (eggs)
- uterus - the middle part of the vagina where basically everything happens (fertilized egg will be implanted to develop into a fetus)
- cervix - muscle at the lower end of the vagina that prevents the egg from falling out, keeps the developing fetus in place during pregnancy
- vagina - tube that leads to the inside of the woman's body where the male penis will enter during intercourse.

why did i write this

### role of oestrogen and progesterone

oestrogen produces female secondary characteristics (but also the beginning of a period (menstruation))

progesterone strengthens the uterus lining - stimulates the growth of blood vessels during the later part of menstruation. If fertilized egg cell, then progesterone will keep on being created, but if not, then the uterus lining breaks down (progesterone stops being created)

### placenta

placenta is created once embryo is 'made' - will allow the embryo to obtain materials from the mother's blood (through stuff like diffusion) - also allows embryo to get rid of waste products (such as carbon dioxide and urea) - it also anchors the embryo in the uterus (because it's connected to the mother's body). The placenta secretes female hormones (progesterone to maintain uterus lining)

### fetus + amniotic fluid

once the embryo gets to a point where it's recognizable it's called a fetus

amniotic fluid is fluid that protects the baby from sudden movements and bumps (kinda like a membrane cushion if you want to think of it that way)

### effects of puberty (oestrogen and testosterone secondary sexual characteristics)

- boys - sperm production starts; growth of pubic hair; growth of mass (muscle mass for example in chest); deeper voice (voice breaks); sexual 'drive' develops; growth and development of organs
- female - menstrual cycle begins (they start getting puberty woo); growth and development of female sexual organs; growth of pubic hair; increase in body mass (rounder hips); voice deepens without 'breaking'; sexual drive develops; breasts develop

### genome Definition

the entire DNA of an organism (the amount present in a diploid cell) is known as a genome. (sum total of the organisms dna)

### polygenic inheritance

gene definition: section of dna that codes for one specific protein

Most Characteristics are Controlled by More than One Gene and are Described as being Polygenic

Polygenic Characteristics have Phenotypes that can Show a Wide Range of Combinations in Features

(3.22 understand that most phenotypic features are the result of polygenic inheritance
rather than single genes) - basically we need to know that phenotypes are a result of many other genes as opposed to just one gene.

### gamete definition

haploid that is able to 'unite with the other gender's gamete' for example pollen is a male gamete that will become a zygote

### natural selection - darwin theory

basically he realized that animals generally produce more offspring than are needed to replace them (for example salmon release like 50000000 eggs per year), but that organism population stays stable (generally the same size), which means that there's a survival of the fittest thing because there are the same amount and those well suited to live will live.

### understanding terms (ecosystems)

population/community/habitat/ecosystem

- population - amount of members of a specific species
- habitat - place where organisms live
- community - population of different species of organisms in the habitat they live in
- ecosystems - living organisms in a place and the interactions between them

ecosystem contains a variety of habitats. (habitats in a pond ecosystem include water, mud at bottom of pond, surface water - different animals can live in these different places)

population of all species found in an ecosystem is called a community.

Basically ecosystem is kinda equal to community, while population is kinda equal to habitat if that makes sense.

### biotic and abiotic factors affecting population and distribution

- biotic factors (biological factors)
  - feeding relationships
    - availability of food and competition for resources
    - predation (predators)
    - parasitism (parasites)
    - disease
    - presence of pollinating insects
    - availability of nest sites
- abiotic factors (chemical/physical factors)
  - climate (light intensity, water availability, temperature)
  - hours of daylight
  - soil conditions (clay conditions, nitrate level, water content, pH)
  - salt content, flow rate in a river, oxygen concentration in a lake etc
  - pollution

Which factors depend on the type of ecosystem (for example in a lake the main abiotic factors could be depth of waters, flow rate, salt content, type of material at the bottom of the stream, minerals in the water etc)

### The carbon cycle

- the cycle of carbon

respiration - breathing does this thing where oxygen in the air is turned into carbon dioxide (which has carbon according to the name) - respiration is needed for energy (cells get energy through respiration in the form of ATP)

photosynthesis will transfer carbon dioxide into oxygen

combustion releases carbon dioxide (sometimes carbon or carbon monoxide, but there is still carbon released)

decomposers respire which also causes more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (along with decay and absorption causing carbon dioxide)

### pollution of air (sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide - acid rain)

carbon monoxide - something to do with haemoglobins - they will bind with carbon monoxide and therefore haemoglobin will be bound to carbon monoxide and cannot bind to oxygen so they cannot respire

sulphur dioxide - part of acid rain (formed when fossil fuels are burned and combines with water droplets in the air which will make the rain even more acidic (carbon dioxide is acidic, so is sulphur dioxide)) which will damage ecosystems (lakes get more acidic, soil gets more acidic, slows plant growth due to root hairs being more ineffective) possibly algae die, bacteria die due to a higher amount of acidity etc

lichens are good at detecting sulfur dioxide (because they are really sensitive towards sulfur dioxide)

### pollution of water by sewage

sewage is wet waste from houses, factories and farms. sewage usually contains human urine and faeces along with dissolved organic and inorganic chemicals (such as soaps and detergent). It is carried away in pipes called sewers to be treated before it enters waterways.

If sewage is discharged without treatment, there are many problems:

1. aerobic bacteria in the water polluted by the sewage use up dissolved oxygen in the water (which means there's less oxygen for other organisms to use in the water)
2. untreated sweage contains pathogenic bacteria, which are a danger to both human health and animals living inside the water

### eutrophication caused by leached minerals

eutrophication - it means well fed - so basically waters get too well fed with phospates and nitrates (either by fertilizer or untreated sewage), which makes an algal bloom due to the increase of mineral ions that plants use. The algae will soon start to die which will then be decomposed by bacteria (that use oxygen) so there will be less oxygen for plants and animals living in the water. Additionally, the algae blocks light which means plants underwater will not be able to photosynthesize which further lowers the amount of oxygen (+ without photosynthesis the plants will eventually die). In severe cases, the water becomes anoxic (very little oxygen) where only anaerobic bacteria will be able to survive.

Eutrophication will be less likely to happen when farmers use organic fertilizer (eg manure) - the nitrogen compounds are less soluble so less likely to be leached from the plant.

### greenhouses (glasshouses) and polythene tunnels (polytunnels) can provide very controlled conditions for plants to grow. There are several reasons:

1. enough natural light can come through during the summer months, while additional lighting can be artificially added during the winter months.
2. the greenhouse effect doesn't just happen to the Earth, but also in greenhouses (which means the area stays warmer), may be more optimal for some plants' enzymes
3. greenhouse conditions can be changed(ie temperature)
4. conditions can be perfect for the plant (moisture, mineral ions), everything can be controlled

this is cause wavelengths are shorter (higher frequency) when entering the greenhouse, but the waves lose energy, so they lower frequency when leaving.

Shorter wavelengths are also generally warmer.

### increased carbon dioxide and temperature on crop yield

temperature - plants have an optimum temperature and raising it to reach the optimum will produce more efficient photosynthesis which will gives the plants more energy which will then lead to increased enzyme activity then to crop yield of plants

with more carbon dioxide (if you combust something then there will be carbon dioxide (for example for heating)), then the plants will have more carbon dioxide to use in photosynthesis (because carbon dioxide is a part of photosynthesis)

### fertilizer to increase crop yield

fertilizer adds mineral ions that help plants grow (for example magnesium for chloroplasts along with nitrates for amino acids and proteins (+ phosphates and potassium))

### pest control

basically pests are organisms that reduce the yield of plants so sometimes farmers will want to remove the pests because they cause economic damage to the farmers.

There are two methods to reduce pests - pesticides or biological control

**pesticides** - named according to the type of organism they kill: (just remember pesticides)

- herbicides - kills plant weeds
- insecticides - lol
- fungicides - kill fungi
- molluscicides - kills snails and slugs

problems with pesticides:

- pests may develop resistance to the chemical (due to mutation - rare and random changes to the genetic code, usually not even beneficial) along with natural selection
- pesticides may be slow to decompose - persistent in the environment
- build up in the tissues of organisms - bioaccumulation (and humans may end up eating these organisms)
- build up and become more concentrated along food chains
- kill other insects that are harmless (as well as helpful species such as bees)

biological control:

- several methods
  - introducing a natural predator for the pests
  - introducing a herbivore (if the pests are plants)
  - introducing a parasite (basically a natural predator)
  - introducing a pathogenic microorganism (why)
  - introducing sterile males (so females mate but no babies are produced)
  - using pheromones (natural chemical produced by insects to attract a mate)

problems: the pest will not fully die out (because if they do then the introduced method of biological control will die) - it only aims to reduce pest numbers to levels where it does not cause significant economic damage.

### Role of yeast in bread and alcoholic drinks

anaerobic respiration in yeast: glucose -> ethanol + some energy + carbon dioxide

yeast in bread -  yeast respires during the making of bread, producing water and carbon dioxide (aerobic). The carbon dioxide makes the dough rise. When the air runs out, the yeast starts to make carbon dioxide and ethanol. When the dough is baked in the oven, the gas bubbles expand which gives the bread a light cellular texture. This also kills the yeast and evaporates any ethanol from the fermentation.

### practical to test for carbon dioxide produced by anaerobic respiration in yeast

water is gently boiled in a boiling tube to remove any air, then is cooled, then sugar is added and dissolved. Finally a bit of yeast is added and the mixture is stirred. Then, paraffin (oil) is added to the surface which will stop oxygen diffusing from the air.

Then you have the tube connected to another tube with limewater, if it turns milky anaerobic respiration will emit carbon dioxide.

### bacteria (lactic acid bacteria) - turn the liquid milk into semi-solid food (yogurt)

To make yogurt - milk is pasteurised at 85-95 degrees to kill any natural bacteria, then homogenized to disperse fat. The milk is then cooled to 40 Celsius and then two species of bacteria (one of which is lactic acid bacteria) is added. These bacteria produce lactic acid as well as digesting the milk proteins. (ph is 4.4 because optimum)

### genetically modifying Plants

restriction enzyme to cut, ligase to join

vectors can transfer plasmids onto specific cells

some plants have been engineered to have extended 'shelf life' - other crop plants have been modified to be resistant to herbicides (weedkillers) which allows farmers to spray herbicides without affecting the crop plant. Additionally, some plants have been modified to be resistant to the cold (from insertion of anti-freeze code from Arctic fish)

(to increase yield)

### transgenic

meaning - organism that receives the gene from a different species is transgenic (trans is the prefix for transfer)

### ingestion

4 stages of digestion:

1. ingestion (ingest)
2. digestion (digest)
3. absorption (absorb nutrients)
4. elimination (excrete)

### structure of the eye

iris - the thing covering the lens - controls how much light enters the pupil (this is done with the use of circular and radial muscles (circular muscles contract to make the lens cover more of the pupil))

cornea - it's the see through thing that lets light through (refracts light)

lens - transparent disc that focuses light onto the retina

optic nerve - transforms the image formed on the retina to the brain (impulses from the eye to the brain)

retina - contains rods and cones that detect light

pupil - hole that allows light to enter to be focused on the retina

ciliary muscles - ring of muscles that changes shape to change the shape of the lens

> The tough outer coat is called the **sclera** (visible white part of the eye)
>
> The **cornea** is a transparent window (which lets light into the eye)
>
> behind the cornea is the iris (amomunt of allowed light through) and behind that the pupil
>
> the lens is a transparent thing (kinda like the membrane) - changes shape to change the focus depending on distance of object.

### stomata

allow oxygen and water vapour to diffuse out - and allows carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf. Guard cells will change their shape to open or close the stoma
