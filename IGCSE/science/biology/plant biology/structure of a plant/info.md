# Structure of a Plant

### Internal Structure of a leaf

- Cuticle – a transparent waxy layer to prevent water loss
  - On the top of the leaf
- Epidermis – a transparent protective layer on the upper and lower edges of the leaf
  - called upper epidermis and lower epidermis - upper is close to the cuticle
- Guard cells – pairs of cells that form stoma that control the exit and entrance of CO2 and O2 in and out of the leaf. Mostly found on the lower surface of the leaf.
- Palisade layer – found just under the top epidermis and contains palisade cells that contain the most chloroplasts. This is the main site for photosynthesis.
- Spongy layer – contains cells that create many air spaces that allows easy movement, entrance and exit for water, CO2 and O2 . Also contains the xylem which transport water and minerals around the plant and the phloem which transports the sugars made in photosynthesis.
