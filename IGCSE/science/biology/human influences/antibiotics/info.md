# Antibiotics

- Is a medical drug
- Works to block metabolic pathways/biochemical reactions in **bacteria**
- Ineffective for viruses (only for bacteria)
- Effect = deactivate or kill bacteria

*Viruses and Bacteria are both examples of pathogens*

> Firstly, what is a virus?
>
> They contain a nucleus inside a protein coat. **They are not alive**, but are coded to lock onto living cells of other organisms and replicate themselves.
>
> Because they do not have a metabolic pathway/biochemical reactions, they are unaffected by antibiotics.

---

> Bacteria are living things that replicate (with a process similar to mitosis), so they are also able to mutate to be resistant to antibiotics. This will eventually make antibiotics more and more ineffective.
>
> More and more bacteria are resistant to more and more types of antibiotics.

#### Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus

Staphylococcus Aureus is bacteria that is on skin. This bacteria will dissolve your flesh, and a type of antibiotic will not work to solve this. Eventually, this will be a huge problem. Think of the time when the bacteria is resistant to all types of antibiotics. What will happen? (phages maybe)
