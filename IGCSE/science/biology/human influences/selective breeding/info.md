# Selective Breeding

What happens:

1. Decide which characteristics are important
2. Choose parents that show these characteristics
3. Mate the chosen parents
4. Select the best offspring
5. Repeat

This will eventually make the % of a specific species with desirable characteristics more prominent (and higher) in the population.

### Speeding up the process of selective breeding

Selective breeding is a very slow process.

Possible solutions:
- Micro propagation of plants
  - the propagation of plants by growing plantlets in tissue culture and then planting them out.
- Artificial Insemination in animals
  - the introduction of semen into a woman or a female animal by natural or artificial means.
- Embryo transfer in animals
- Cloning of animals
  - In reproductive cloning, researchers remove a mature somatic cell, such as a skin cell, from an animal that they wish to copy. They then transfer the DNA of the donor animal's somatic cell into an egg cell, or oocyte, that has had its own DNA-containing nucleus removed.
