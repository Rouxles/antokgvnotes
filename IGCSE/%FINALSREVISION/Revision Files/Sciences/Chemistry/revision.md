### Saturated Solutions

Saturated solutions are solutions which contain as much dissolved solid as possible at a particular temperature (there must be some undissoved solute present)

---

### Crystalisation to separate a mixture

Separate sodium chloride from sodium chloride solution

- The solution is heated up so an almost saturated solution is formed
  - This can be tested by dipping a glass rod into the solution and seeing if crystals form on the glass rod when removed from the solution
- Then bunsen burner is then turned off and the crystals can form when more water evaporates and the solution cools down. The crystals can now be removed from the mixture by filtration

### Electrical conductivity and acid-base to separate between metals and non-metals

- Non metals do not conduct electricity while metals conduct electricity
  - Non metals do not conduct electricity because there are no electrons that are free to move or mobile irons, but there are a few exceptions (such as giant covalent structures such as graphite or silicon)
- Metals generally form basic oxides
  - For example, copper oxide (is a basic oxide because it reacts with an acid to form water)
  - Copper Oxide + Sulfuric acid becomes copper sulfate and water
- Non metals generally form acidic oxides (for example sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide)

### Alkali Metals

Similarities with: Reactions with water

- react with water to produce a metal hydroxide and hydrogen
- The main difference is the speed of the Reaction
- They all react with water in the same way

Trends based on: Reaction with air and water

- reactions happen faster as you go down the group
- sodium melts into a ball because a lot of heat is produced from the reaction (it is exothermic)
- sodium fizzes
- moves around don the surface of the water
- the metal hydroxide formed is alkaline

lithium: slower

potassium: faster than sodium - enough heat is produced to ignite the hydrogen which will burn with a lilac flame and ends with the potassium spitting around and exploding

rubidium and caesium: reacts even more violently

---

Reaction with air:

Will react with air more when you go down the periodic table

---

### Halogens

gets more reactive as you go up the periodic table

physical state at room temperature

|  | Physical state | Colour     |
|:--| :------------- | :------------- |
| Fluorine | Gas      | Yellow       |
| Chlorine | Gas | Green |
| Bromine | Liquid | Orange |
| Iodine | Solid | Grey solid, puple vapour |

Basically, you can tell that the colour goes darker the more you go down the table

### Rusting

Iron rusts when there is oxygen and water present

---

### Reactions of metals with dilute acids

- Setup four test tubes and put about 2cm3 of dilute hydrochloric acid into each one
- Put magnesium, zinc iron and copper into each and observe any reaction that occurs
- If there is any fizzing, collect or trap the gas and see what gas it is (it's hydrogen)
- repeat with sulfuric and nitric acid

- Magnesium
  - reacts violently with lots of fizzing
  - colourless solution is formed
  - test tube gets hot
- Zinc
  - steady reaction with fizzing
  - with enough gas, will hydrogen test
  - colourless solution formed
  - test tube gets warmer
- iron
  - slow fizzing,
  - very little gas collected in the time available
  - pale green solution formed
  - test tube gets slightly warmer
- copper
  - no change (below hydrogen in the reactivity series)

all these reactions are exothermic

---

### See whether something is acid or alkali using 3 different things

- Litmus
  - turns red or blue depending on whether it's acid or alkali (red for acid, blue for alkali)
- Methyl Orange
  - Turns red when acid, yellow when alkali
- Phenolphthalein
  - colourless when acid, pink when alkali

---

### Gases in the atmosphere

- Percentage of common gases in the air
  - Oxygen: 21%
  - Nitrogen: 78%
  - Carbon Dioxide: 0.04%
  - Argon: 0.9%

copper tube with two syringes where you keep on pushing air over the copper and oxygen gets diminished

volume of air in conical flask, connecting tube, gas syringe initial and final, then you can find % based on that

---

### Burning in oxygen

- Magnesium
  - bright white flame
- sulfur - sulfur dioxide is produced (with a blue flame while burning)
- hydrogen - pale blue flame, makes water.

---

### carbonate with heat becomes metal oxide + carbon dioxide

---

### energetics

reactions for combustion, displacement, dissolving and neutralisation

- Combustion
  - hydrogen + oxygen produces water and a lot of heat (any reaction that produces a flame)
- Displacement
  - Reactivity series with oxides or halogens or something to do with organic
- Dissolving
  - salts dissolve in water temperature changes
- Neutralisation
  - acid + alkali

---

### Organic (functional group)

an atom or a group of atoms that determine the chemical properties of a compound

for example: functional group for alkenes is c=c

---

### trend for main fractions

boiling point gets higher as the mr goes up

liquids become less volatile and more viscous the larger the hydrocarbon

darker in colour

harder to burn

(as mr goes up for all)

---

### reaction with ultraviolet stuffs

monosubstitution - only one hydrogen atom is replaced with a halogen

alkanes react with halogens in uv. Hydrogen atom in the alkane is replaced with a halogen atom

---

### polymers

tetra means 4
