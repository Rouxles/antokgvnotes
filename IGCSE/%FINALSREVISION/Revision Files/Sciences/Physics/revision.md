### Forces

List of different types of forces

- Electrostatic
- Force due to gravity/weight
- Normal reaction
- Magnetic
- Friction
- Drag
- Thrust
- Upthrust
- Lift
  - Upwards forces on aeroplanes

### Mains electricity

> understand how the use of insulation, double insulation, earthing, fuses and circuit breakers protects the device or user in a range of domestic appliances

- Insulation
  - Insulators prevent electricity from flowing through it (especially because the resistance is so high on them and they aren't conductive (so they don't get energy))
- Double Insulation
  - Double insulation is when electrical parts of the component can never touch the outside casing - thus not needing an earth wire
    - An earth wire is a low resistance path for the current to take to the earth (so the electricity will flow that way)
- Fuses and circuit breakers will break/blow if the current going through it is too high
  - Circuit breakers can be turned on again, not needing to be reinstalled and are also faster at cutting off the current
  - Fuses are cheaper and need to be replaced before the appliance can be used again.

### Resistance and heat

> understand why a current in a resistor results in the electrical transfer of energy and an increase in temperature, and how this can be used in a variety of domestic contexts

The wiring in a house is designed to let current pass through it easily, which makes the wires not become warm when the appliances are being used.

Resistance happens when electrons inside a circuit collide with each other (and thus lose a bit of energy) but then more rapid collisions also leads to greater heat.

Some appliances try to get high resistance (such as toasters of hairdryers)

### Voltage and stuff

In any current, voltage is the driving force.

Any component added will increase the resistance, thus decreasing current.

To test experimentally, have resistor, voltmeter and ammeter

---

### Current - rate of flow of charge

I = Q/t

---

### energy transferred

E = IVt

E = P t

E = QV

Q = It

---

### absorption and emission of radiation

shiny surfaces reflect radiation better

rough surfaces absorb radiation better

---

### Radiation

IR Waves

white surfaces reflect a lot of IR, matte black and dark surfaces are good absorbers of thermal radiation

---

### Electromagnetism

**Magnetically Hard/Soft Materials**

- Magnetically Hard
  - These materials keep their magnetism once it has been magnetised
  - steel
- Magnetically Soft
  - These materials lose their magnetism easily (and are useful as temporary magnets)
  - iron

### Moving coil loudspeaker

Currents pass through the coils of a speaker

Currents always change in size and direction (like vibrating sound waves)

Fields of the coil and permanent magnet are creating magnetic field patterns which always change in size and direction

These apply rapidly changing forces to the wires of the coil - causing the speaker cone to vibrate

---

### Radiation

Beta decay involves a neutron splitting into a proton and an electron, where the proton remains in the nucleus, and the electron is ejected at a high speed (as a beta particle)

To test for penetrating power of radiation, use gm tube with a counter (and stopwatch)

---

### sources of bg radiation

carbon 14, radon, space (cosmic rays from sun)

---

### contamination vs irradiation

Irradiation is temporary, contamination is permanent
