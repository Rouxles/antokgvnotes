### shift in supply curve

- production costs
- taxes/subsidies
- technology
- natural factors

---

### ped definition

the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price

---

### factors affecting ped

- substitutes
- % spent of income
- level of necessity
- time
  - time to find substitutes when prices rise in short term
  - long term they can find alternatives and are more prepared to switch

---

### factors affecting pes

- factors of production
- time storage ability
- amount of storage space
- availability of stocks

---

### pes for primary and manufactured products

- goods that can be provided quickly have greater elasticity of supply
  - for example, cars in the manufacturing industry
- however, goods coming from the primary sector typically are supply inelastic because they take time to produce and are not able to react quickly to price changes (for example, strawberries or wheat from the farming industry)

---

### income elasticity of demand

> definition
>
> change in the demand for a product in response to the change in the income of a consumer (responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in income)

significance of this for firms and government:

if firms know income elasticity, they can adjust their prices to predicted changes in income.

---

### mixed economy

mixed economy is an economy where goods and services are provided by both the public and the private sector

public sector: government organisations that provide goods and services in the economy

private sector: firms owned by individuals or groups that provide goods and services in the economy.

**market faliure**

this is where markets lead to inefficiencies (where the public sector has to provide goods and services that the private sector is unable to produce in sufficient quantities)

**privitisation**

Selling a company or activity controlled by the government to private investors or firms

transferring public sector resources to the private sector

---

### external costs

definition: negative effects that consumers need to experience due to production or consumption not related to them (third party)

---

### division of labour

breaking down of production into small parts with each worker or a group of workers allocated to that specific task

---

EoS/DoS

EoS: falling average costs due to an increase in the size and output of a firm

DoS: rising average costs when the firm gets too big

---

### EEoS

external economies of scale: benefits that firms in an industry can enjoy when the industry expands

---

### oligopoly

market dominated by a few large firms

non price competition: eg coupons, loyalty cards to get people back to their company. marketing stuff

price competition: generally prices stay the same for quite long periods of time

---

### labour market

factors affecting supply of labour

- age
- demographic
- minimum wage
- retirement age
- education and training
- ability to move
- school leaving age
- population

---

### trade union

trade unions exist to protect interest of workers

they negotiate pay with employers, provide legal protection for members, put pressure on the government to pass legislation that improves rights of workers, and provide financial benefits

---

### economic growth

the constant rise of gdp over a period of time

increase in the level of output by a nation over a period of time

---

### role of the wto

- eliminate trade barriers through negotiation (encourages countries to draw up trading agreements which cover things like anti-dumping, subsidies and product standards.)
- monitors the application of the WTO's rules for trade in goods, services etc. All WTO members must conduct regular reviews of their trade policies and practices and submit reports to the WTO
- the wto settles trade disputes (making sure that trade flows smoothly and that every party is following the rules)
- the wto also helps new members to join (so that world trade is easier as a whole)
