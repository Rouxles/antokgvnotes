# Hexadecimal

Hex is base 16, which works really well in tandem with base 2 because 4 bits of base 2 (a nibble) is equal to one Hex value, which makes it way easier for humans to read in comparison to something like binary.

A few reasons why Hex is used over binary in some situations:
- It is used for easier human readability (as stated above)
  - Something like 4C is already nicer than something like 01011001 - way easier to read, and it scales up the more bytes a human has to read. Less chance for error for a human (but doesn't make much of a difference for a computer, which will most likely want to read base 2 as opposed to base 16).

Seriously, hex is basically only for human readability (but there are other uses for Hex which aren't really needed in IGCSE Compsci)
