# Chemical Pollution

> There has to be a scientific Emphasis – So that means for each form of pollution I am expecting a full explanation of how that form of pollution is produced (there must be balanced chemical equations included for each type), What effects does the pollution have on the environment? How can the amount of pollution be reduced? (either at source or by removing the gases after the process – carbon capture/sulphur scrubbing etc – explanations of how they work needed)

### Global Warming

- Greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide/methane) trap hot air in the earth, gradually increasing the overall temperature in our planet.

- This causes our world many problems such as melting ice caps, and gradually increasing temperatures (which possibly means less beneficial parasites that cannot live in hotter conditions)

- This may also cause rising sea level, making some islands around the world be sunken by the water (for example, the Maldives)

### Acid Rain

**Acid Rain is caused by 2 main sources**

- Sulphur
  - One of the sources of Acid Rain is Sulphur. Sulphur is released mostly from the generation of electricity from materials that have sulphur, such as coal, natural gases or oil. This is released into the air in the form of Sulphur Dioxide and then is 'absorbed' by clouds (They mix and react with air/oxygen to create more acidic pollutants as well). This is one of the elements in acid rain.
  - S + O2 -> SO2 - Sulphur + Oxygen will make Sulphur Dioxide in some way (as long as the combustion 'material' consists of Sulphur)

- Nitrogen
  - Another important element in acid rain is Nitrogen. Nitrogen is released in the form of nitrogen oxide. This is also released from human consumption (such as combustion) alongside farm animals, sewages and fertilizers.
  - Nitrogen dioxide is formed when reacting in air with the elements Nitric Oxide and Oxygen in air (2NO + O2 -> 2NO2)
    - At high temperatures, nitrogen will combine with oxygen to make nitric oxide.

When these combine together, they create Acid Rain, which is very dangerous for our environment because this acid can kill plants and animals living in the waters, and can seriously damage our ecosystem.

Sometimes, acidic rain occurs naturally, but these are relatively close to neutral (5 pH). Normal precipitation usually gets neutralized by reacting with alkaline chemicals or non-acidic chemicals, thus neutralizing the acidity. However, if the acidity levels go too high, the neutralizing will not be strong enough, causing acidic rain.

Acidic rain can be stopped by having less human consumption of electricity so dependent on combustion. Nuclear (fission) can be used as a reliable (but dangerous) source of energy that does not release any chemicals that cause acid rain (although the daughter nuclei made from the reaction are radioactive and ionizing, but they can be dealt with).

### Carbon Monoxide

**The chemical formula of Carbon monoxide is CO, which is dangerously close to carbon dioxide. Why is this important?**

Carbon Monoxide limits the transfer of oxygen by red blood cells to organs due to blocking out the hemoglobin of the red blood cell and not ever 'escaping' the cell. At a high enough concentration (maybe due to a poorly ventilated room), carbon monoxide can kill. Carbon monoxide is invisible, so you will be unable to see it in the air, which adds a layer to the deadliness of carbon monoxide.

Carbon monoxide mainly comes from incomplete combustion (for example, cars emit carbon monoxide, and without a catalytic converter, the carbon monoxide will be emitted into the air, making it a very good indicator as to the density of cars.)

### Global Dimming

Global dimming is the idea where our world is getting more and more darker due to the increasing amount of pollutions/clouds causing more blockage of light from our sun.
