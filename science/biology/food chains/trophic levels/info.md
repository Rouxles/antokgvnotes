# Trophic Levels

---

> A trophic level is the position an organism occupies in a food chain. A food chain starts at **trophic level 1** with primary producers such as plants, can move to **herbivores** at level 2, **carnivores** at level 3 or higher, and **typically finish with apex predators** at level 4 or 5. The path along the chain can form either a one-way flow or a food "web". Ecological communities with higher biodiversity form more complex trophic paths.

Below are the typical trophic levels names

| Trophic Levels | Example |
| :-------------: | :--- |
| **Producer** (Photosynthetic) | Plant |
| **Primary Consumer** (Herbivore) | Grasshopper |
| **Secondary Consumer** (Carnivore) | Mouse |
| **Tertiary Consumer** (Carnivore) | Snake |
| **Quaternary Consumer** (Carnivore) [you don't need to remember this for IGCSE] | Hawk |

Main concept - It is less efficient to be an apex predator because you lose a lot of efficiency (primary consumers do not harness all the energy that they can get from producers, inefficient, and this chain continues, so it gets less and less efficient. There is only so much food for the apex predator which is why there aren't many predators.)
